/*
 * Scaled down version of printf(3).
 *
 * One additional format:
 *
 * The format %b is supported to decode error registers.
 * Its usage is:
 *
 *	printf("reg=%b\n", regval, "<base><arg>*");
 *
 * where <base> is the output base expressed as a control character, e.g.
 * \10 gives octal; \20 gives hex.  Each arg is a sequence of characters,
 * the first of which gives the bit number to be inspected (origin 1), and
 * the next characters (up to a control character, i.e. a character <= 32),
 * give the name of the register.  Thus:
 *
 *	printf("reg=%b\n", 3, "\10\2BITTWO\1BITONE\n");
 *
 * would produce output:
 *
 *	reg=3<BITTWO,BITONE>
