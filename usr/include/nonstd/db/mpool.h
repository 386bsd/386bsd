 * The memory pool scheme is a simple one.  Each in memory page is referenced
 * by a bucket which is threaded in three ways.  All active pages are threaded
 * on a hash chain (hashed by the page number) and an lru chain.  Inactive
 * pages are threaded on a free chain.  Each reference to a memory pool is
 * handed an MPOOL which is the opaque cookie passed to all of the memory
 * routines.
