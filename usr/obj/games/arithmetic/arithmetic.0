       _A_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c   asks   you   to   solve  problems  in  simple
       arithmetic.  Each  question  must  be  answered  correctly
       before  going on to the next.  After every 20 problems, it
       prints the score so far and the time taken.  You can  quit
       at  any  time  by  typing  the  interrupt  or  end-of-file
       character.

       The options are as follows:

       -o     By default, _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c asks questions  on  addition
              of   numbers   from  0  to  10,  and  corresponding
              subtraction.  By  supplying  one  or  more  of  the
              characters  ++--xx//,  you  can  ask  for  problems  in
              addition,    subtraction,    multiplication,    and
              division,  respectively.   If you give one of these
              characters more than once,  that  kind  of  problem
              will be asked correspondingly more often.

       -r     If  a  _r_a_n_g_e  is  supplied,  _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c selects the
              numbers in its problems in the following way.   For
              addition  and  multiplication,  the  numbers  to be
              added  or  multiplied  are  between  0  and  _r_a_n_g_e,
              inclusive.   For subtraction and division, both the
              required result and the  number  to  divide  by  or
              subtract  will be between 0 and _r_a_n_g_e.  (Of course,
              _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c will not ask you to divide by  0.)   The
              default _r_a_n_g_e is 10.

       When you get a problem wrong, _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c will remember the
       numbers involved, and will tend to  select  those  numbers
       more  often  than  others,  in  problems of the same sort.
       Eventually it will forgive and forget.

       _A_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c cannot be  persuaded  to  tell  you  the  right
       answer.  You must work it out for yourself.

       ``What?''  if you get a question wrong.  ``Right!'' if you
       get it right.  ``Please type  a  number.''  if  arithmetic
       doesn't understand what you typed.
