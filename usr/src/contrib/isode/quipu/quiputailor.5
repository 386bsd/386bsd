.SH NAME
.BR quiputailor ,
.B dsaptailor
\- QUIPU tailoring file
.SH DESCRIPTION
Both programs using the DUA library, \fIlibdsap\fR\0(5), and the QUIPU
DSA (\fIquipu\fR\0(8c)), use runtime tailoring files which are read on
startup.
.PP
The files consist of single line entries.  Each entry has a label followed by
a sequence of values.
.SH "GENERIC VARIABLES"
The parameters used by both the DUA and DSA, are:
.IP oidtable
The path for the object identifier tables,
having extensions \fI\&.gen\fR, \fI\&.at\fR, and \fI\&.oc\fR.
NOTE This MUST be the first entry in the tailor file.
.IP logdir
The default directory prefix in which the log files are placed.
.IP isode
The argument should be treated as an ISODE variable / value pair as found in 
isode \fIisotailor\fR\0(5).
.IP stats
Control statistical logging (see dsaplog below for values).
.IP dsaplog
Tailoring for the "normal" logging file.
Each entry consists of one or more key/value pairs expressed as
.sp
.in +.5i
key=value
.in -.5i
.sp
The keys are:
.RS
.IP level
Print log messages at any of the following levels
.RS
.IP fatal
Fatal errors only.
.IP exceptions
Serious but hopefully temporary errors.
.IP notice
General logging information.
.IP trace
Program tracing shown.
.IP debug
Debug notices
.IP pdus
Trace of PDU's
.IP all
Log all levels
.RE
.IP dflags
See sflags below.
.IP sflags
The flags associated with the log may be set with sflag values or
unset with dflag values. The allowable options are:
.RS
.IP close
Close the log after each entry.
.IP create
Create the log file if it doesn't exist.
.IP zero
Zero the file when it gets too big.
.IP tty
Copy the logging info to the standard error.
.RE
.RE
.SH "DSA SPECIFIC VARIABLES"
.IP treedir
directory path in which the database is stored.
.IP mydsaname
distinguished name of this DSA.
.IP parent
Name and address pair of a superior DSA.    Only needed for DSAs not
holding a copy of the root entry data block.
.IP update
The value "on" tells the DSA to attempt to update SLAVE EDB files
during startup.
.IP dspchaining
The value "off" tells the DSA not to chain DSP requests to other DSAs, 
by default the DSA makes the choice based on a set of heuristics.
.IP lastmodified
If the value is "off" lastmodified by attributes will not be added to entries
by the DSA.
.IP searchlevel
Defines the level from which normal users can search the DIT.
.IP adminsize
Set the administrative size limit.
.IP admintime
Set the administrative time limit.
.IP cachetime
The length of time a DSA can trust cached information.
.IP slavetime
The time between updates of slave EDB files.
.IP retrytime
The length of time to assume a previously unavailable DSA is still unavailable.
.IP conntime
The length of time to hold an unused DSP connection open.
.IP nsaptime
The length of time to wait before deciding a connection can not be established on a given NSAP.
.IP preferDSA
A list of DSA.
These DSA should be used (in the order given) in preference to 
other DSAs if possible in resolving an operation.
.IP readonly
Bring the DSA up in read only mode.
.SH "DUA SPECIFIC VARIABLES"
.IP sizelimit
maximum number of entries a successful list or search can return.
.IP oidformat
format to display object identifiers in (short, long or numeric).
.IP dsaAddress
name and address of a DSA to initially contact.  This item may be repeated.
.IP local_DIT
The distinguished name of the local sub-tree of the DIT,
This is used to set the DUAs initial position within the DIT.
.IP photo terminal process
Use "process" to display photographs on a "terminal".
.IP quipurc
if the value is "on" the run "dishinit" if a user does not have a ".quipurc"
file.
