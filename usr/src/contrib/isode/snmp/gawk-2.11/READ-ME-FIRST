0.   You should already have installed the 4BSD/ISODE SNMP software.

1.   Get a copy of GNU Awk 2.11.  Extract the gawk-2.11/ hierarchy into
     this directory, snmp/gawk-2.11/.

2.   Apply the patches to the sources by

	% patch -p < GAWK-PATCHES

3.   Follow the instructions in the README file to configure gawk.

4.   If your $(INCDIR) is not /usr/include, then add

	-I$(INCDIR)

     to the "FLAGS=" definition in the Makefile.

5.   Type 

	% make

     to generate gawk.

6.   As the super-user copy gawk to $(BINDIR) and create the directory
     /usr/local/lib/awk.

7.   At this point you should be able to do a trivial test:

	% gawk -f s-gawk/mib.system

     which will contact your local SNMP agent using the default
     community and ask for information from the system group.  The
     output looks something like this:

	agent cheetah.ca.psi.com
	   running: 4BSD/ISODE SNMP
	            (1.3.6.1.4.1.4.1.2.1)
	  services: applications, end-to-end
	  location: upstairs machine room
	   contact: Marshall Rose <mrose@psi.com>
	    uptime: 5 days, 17 hours, 24 minutes, 37.69 seconds

8.   Now you can install the primarly application supplied, s-netstat:

	# (cd s-gawk; ./make inst-all)
