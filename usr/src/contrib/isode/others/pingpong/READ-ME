This is a simple demonstration of asynchronous connection
establishment. It runs as follows.

	pingpong address1 address2

If both addresses are the same it will connect to itself and then
exit. If the addresses are different then it is intended that two
pingpong's are run to allow interconnection with each other. It is
useful both as a simple example of the way to form asynchronous
connections and as a useful way to test that these connections work.

NOTE: This is not the full story, if you are using services above
transport (the usual case) you will need to add a magic parameter to
the TNetListen call to allow fully async establishment.
