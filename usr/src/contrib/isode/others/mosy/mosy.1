.SH NAME
mosy - Managed Object Syntax-compiler (yacc-based)
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fImosy\fR program reads a description of a \fImanaged objects\fR
module and produces a simple ascii file containing equivalent definitions.
This file is meant to be read as configuration data by a network
management program.
.PP
The `\-o' switch sets the name of the output file,
which is normally derived from the name of the input file.
The distinguished file \*(lq\-\*(rq can be used to force the use of the
standard output.
.PP
Normally, \fImosy\fR prints the name of each object, identifier, or type
as it works.
The `\-s' switch disables this behavior.
