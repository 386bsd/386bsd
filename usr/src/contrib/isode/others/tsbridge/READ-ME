    This program is used as a bridge for the OSI transport service.  It
    is solves internetworking problems--if an application uses the OSI
    transport service and runs in multiple environments (TP0/X.25,
    TP4/CLNP, RFC1006/TCP), then the TSB can be used to achieve
    interworking between instances of the application running in
    different networks.

    For example, suppose you have a TCP/IP-based LAN.  Some of the hosts
    on this LAN run RFC1006 and OSI applications on top of that.  One of
    the hosts is connected to an X.25 network.  Normally, only the host
    with the X.25 connection would be able to talk to hosts on the X.25
    net, and vice-versa.  If the dual-homed host runs a TSB, then hosts
    on the LAN running RFC1006 can talk to "pure" OSI hosts on the X.25
    network, and vice-versa.
