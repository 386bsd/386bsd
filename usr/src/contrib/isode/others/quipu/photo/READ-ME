PHOTOGRAPHS in the QUIPU directory service.

Use pr2pe to convert sunview pixrect files into `pe' files.

Currently there are several picture display processes defined:-
Xphoto   - Display photo in X11 window environment
xfax     - Display photo in X11 window environment (fine resolution)
sunphoto - Display photo in sunview environment
ttyphoto - Display photo on a simple terminal
hexphoto - Display photo in hex !!!
t4014	 - Display on Tetronix 4014 (emulating !) terminals.
fax2ps   - Convert the photo to postscript

Each can be tested with the file "sk"
e.g. ttyphoto < sk

Display for other devices can be easily added.
Take a copy of template.c, and supply the 5 routines defined.
Look at sunview.c hexphoto.c ttyphoto.c t4014.c and winx.c examples.
Then compile using:
cc -o myphoto d_main.o decode.o build_trees.o interface.o myphoto.o

To get the QUIPU interfaces to call these routine when a photo is loaded, an
entry of the form
photo falco ttyphoto
is needed in your dsaptailor file.
This will tell the interfaces to use the program `typhoto' if your 
terminal type (determined from the TERM environment variable) is `falco'.

ttyphoto's output can be modified with 4 environment variables:

photo_scale: 	set to `small' (default), `medium' or `large'.
photo_invert:	set true or false.
photo_equal:    false - display photo as is.
		true - apply histogram equalisation to try and improve quality.
		edge -  Used `edges by expansion' to try to get a better photo
photo_mapping:  This must contain a 16 charcter string.
		The string is used to create the greyscale.
Suggestions as to how to improve `ttyphoto' are welcome.

To install pbmtofax and faxtopbm, you will need a copy of the PBMPLUS
package.  If you don't have a copy, contact Jef Poskanzer <jef@well.sf.ca.us>
Once you have acquired PBMPLUS, build the libpbm.a library (go to the
pbm/ directory in the PBMPLUS source tree and type make).  Next edit the
Makefile in this directory to set the PBMDIR make variable to reflect
where the top of the PBMPLUS source tree is located.  Finally, type

	% make pbm
	# make inst-all
