PHOTOGRAPHS in the QUIPU directory service.

Use pr2pe to convert sunview pixrect files into `pe' files.

Currently there are 5 picture display processes defined:-
Xphoto   - Display photo in X11 windoow environment
sunphoto - Display photo in sunview environment
ttyphoto - Display photo on a simple terminal
hexphoto - Display photo in hex !!!
t4014	 - Display on Tetronix 4014 (emulating !) terminals.

Each can be tested with the file "sk"
e.g. ttyphoto < sk

Display for other devices can be easily added.
Take a copy of template.c, and supply the 5 routines defined.
Look at sunview.c hexphoto.c ttyphoto.c t4014.c and winx.c examples.
Then compile using:
cc -o myphoto d_main.o decode.o build_trees.o interface.o myphoto.o

To get the QUIPU interfaces to call these routine when a photo is loaded, an
entry of the form
photo falco ttyphoto
is needed in your dsaptailor file.
This will tell the interfaces to use the program `typhoto' if your 
terminal type (determined from the TERM environment variable) is `falco'.

ttyphoto's output can be modified with 4 environment variables:

photo_scale: 	set to `small' (default), `medium' or `large'.
photo_invert:	set true or false.
photo_equal:    false - display photo as is.
		true - apply histogram equalisation to try and improve quality.
		edge -  Used `edges by expansion' to try to get a better photo
photo_mapping:  This must contain a 16 charcter string.
		The string is used to create the greyscale.
Suggestions as to how to improve `ttyphoto' are welcome.
