This directory demonstates how to start a 
DSA holding a copy of the root EDB

*** STARTING UP ***

The start the DSA type
	/etc/ros.quipu -t ./quiputailor
in this directory.

The DSA is started on the address defined in c=GB/EDB
(line 4 - presentationAddress= localHost=17003)


*** UPDATING SLAVES ***

The DSA has also been set up, so that if you add the line :-
	update on
to quiputailor, then the slave copy of the "root" of the DIT you currrently have, 
will be automatically updated by contacting the DSA giant tortoise.
NOTE unless you register your DSA, Giant Tortoise will NOT actually send you
any updates - it will send a security error instead.
The process for registering a QUIPU DSA is 
described fully in Volume 5 of the ISODE manual.

In some cases it may be better to receive updates from a DSA "closer" to you.
To do this, alter the "edbinfo" attribute of cn=toucan (or the entry for your
DSA if you have renamed it) in the file c=GB/EDB
to specify the name of the DSA you want to contact (This DSA does not
have to hold a MASTER copy, it can quite happily hold a SLAVE.)

To alter this to get update of "c=GB" for example, change the 
"edbinfo" attribute for cn=toucan to
edbinfo= c=GB#1#cn=giant tortoise#
This attribute is multi-valued, so you can have more than one of 
these entries, so both the root, and c=GB can be updated.
NOTE, again, Giant Tortoise will not send updates, 
unless you have registered your DSA.
