 Pod - Current Directory Position

 The <Current Directory Position> serves as a
 reference point for the <Search> and <List> 
 operations. For example if the <List> button
 is clicked on when the <Current Directory
 Position> points to "Brunel University", a 
 list showing all departments in Brunel
 will be returned.

 The current position is built up as a sequence
 of increasingly specific object names. To 
 'widen' the search area, or move to a less 
 specific object, click on the name of the 
 object that you wish to move to, in the same
 way as moving to an object contained in a list.
