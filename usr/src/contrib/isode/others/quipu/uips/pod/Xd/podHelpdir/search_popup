 Pod - Search, querying the database

 To construct a search for an entry in the 
 directory database, proceed as follows.

 1) Set the <Type> of the entry that you wish
    to search for by selecting from the popup
    menu associated with the <Change Type>
    button.

 2) Enter a value  into  the  <Search> dialog 
    box that  describes  the  target entry in
    some way.

 3) Press  <Return>  whilst  in  the <Search> 
    dialog  box  or  click   on   the  <Okay>
    button to the activate the search.

 A typical search  is  illustrated below. The
 entry  being   searched   for   is  that  of 
 'Professor   Polonius    Plum   of   Parkway
 Polytechnic. '

 1) Move to the entry for Parkway Polytechnic

 2) Make  sure  that  the   <Type>  field  is
     set to 'Person'.

 3) Enter a value  into  the  <Search> dialog
    box. For  this  example this  value might
    simply be 'Plum' or 'Polonius'.

 4) Start  the  search  by  clicking  on  the 
    <Search> button. 

 The results of  the  query, in the form of a
 list of closely matching  entries should now
 appear.
