Pod version 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	POD is a prototype X-windows based directory user agent (DUA).
	It is intended for novice users, and, as such, has limited 
	functionality. There are no facilities to add entries or to modify
	the RDNs of entries, though most other entry modifications are
	permitted.

INFO
~~~~
	The 'pod' directory has been to designed to fit directly into the
 	'isode' source tree. Specifically, in the directory 
	
		'others/quipu/uips'.

	POD requires X11r4 and the associated X toolkit and Athena 
 	widget libraries.

	Two Postscript documents are provided, `pod.man.ps' a user manual,
	and `pod.guide.ps' an introductory user guide.

COMPILATION
~~~~~~~~~~~
	To compile type
	
			./make

	This should build 'xpod'. To test run ,

			xpod -test

	which runs POD and tells it to read it's config files from the
	source directory.
	
INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Modify the Makefile to suit your system. The location of the 
	'app-defaults' directory (described by APPDEFDIR) might require 
	modification. Installation of POD can be performed by typing 
	
		./make inst-all

	This will install 'pod' and any supporting files/directories, these
  	being configuration directories, help directories and the system
	manual pages.

	if you want to install and clean up the source directory type

		./make install
	
Bug reports and comments.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	All bug reports and other requests to 'X500@brunel.ac.uk'.
	If there are any comments/criticisms you would like to make
	about POD, send them to the above address also as these can
	and (gasp!) often will be fused into the design for further DUAs
	(new designs are currently being implemented under X using the
	Athena widgets and for MS-DOS using Windows 286/386, with
	a planned version for X using the Motif widget set).
