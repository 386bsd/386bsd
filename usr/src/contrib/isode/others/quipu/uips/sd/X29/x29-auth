# Public access to X.500

# Only accepts calls with calling-address starting '0000' (This is appropriate
# to UK JANET-only sites. Others should omit the four zeros)
#
# Command name is /usr/local/lib/public-widget/startup
#
# -x means X29 calls only
#
# -a 000041131503 specifies the address that this service responds to
#
# -u 9681 specifies the UID to run the program under.
# This should be in the passwd file with '*' as password, and should
# NOT be a UID used for any other purpose
#
# -g 9002 specifies the GID. Comments for UID apply. See group file.
#
# -n public-widget specifies the name that will appear in 'ps' output
# when this program is running.

# \ $calling_shortname\ $called_cudf+4
# SPACES ARE SIGNIFICANT!
# This gives the rest of the command line to the program.
# Here, we say that the calling address is to be reverse-translated if
# possible, and used as parameter 1.
# If a Call User Data Field is present (e.g. calls through PSS-JANET gateways)
# it is to be used as parameter 2
