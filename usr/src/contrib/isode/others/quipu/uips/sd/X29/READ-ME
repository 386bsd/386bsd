This directory contains files to help you set up a public-access directory
service on an X29 address.

It assumes the use of x29d, the public-domain X29 listner available from
Cambridge University, UK. For details, mail info-server@cl.cam.ac.uk
with the following message:

Request: catalogue
Topic: x25d
Request: end


It may be possible to mount a similar service using other X29 listners
or even by using telnet on IP networks to call a special port. Neither
option has been tested at Brunel.

Setting up the service:

Make a directory to hold the files. This should be in a stable part of
local filestore. At Brunel we use /usr/local/lib/public-widget.

Copy the script 'startup' to the new directory, and also copy 'LOGIN' to
.login in the same directory.

Edit 'startup' to give appropriate prompts and messages.
If you do not have X installed, you will need to delete the reference
to 'xterm'.

Choose the UID and GID that the service will run under.
Neither should be used for other purposes.
We use numbers in the 9000 range at Brunel. The disadvantage of high numbers
is that some system logfiles suddenly grow, so choose lower numbers if
possible. On UK Pilot machines, very few UIDs are used, so numbers around
70 would be appropriate.

Create a user in /etc/passwd with the appropriate UID and GID. e.g.

x500x29:*:70:70:Public X500 service:/usr/local/lib/public-widget:/bin/csh

This is more for reference than anything else. Nobody will be using this
name to log in.


Add a line to your x29-auth file similar to the one in x29-auth here.
Choose and appropriate X29 address for the service, and make sure that
your x29d is listening on that address.

Create the logfile and make it writable by the chosen UID.
Make sure that the other files and the directory itself are NOT writable
by that UID (e.g. have 'root' own them and do:

	chmod -w * . .login

in that directory.
