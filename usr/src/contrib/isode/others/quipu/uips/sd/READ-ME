This directory contains an OSI directory interface called "sd", derived
from the "widget" interface released with isode-5.0).

It is "full screen" style interface based on the curses library.  To
generate sd you should:

	./make

To test 'sd' enter the following command,

	xsd -test

To install you should:

	./make install

from this directory.  If you do not want to clean up after the install
you can issue the following command instead:

	./make inst-all

The directory 'x29' contains files that allow sd to be set up as
a public-access service.
