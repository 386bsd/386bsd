  The Search  function  will look  for a  given  object contained in
 the "Search Area". Pressing 's'  will  initiate a search. This will
 require you to enter a value  into  the  "Search For" field  first.
 This describes some value or aspect of  the  object  that  you wish
 to search for.

  Associated  with  this  value  is  a  type,  shown  in  the "Type"
 field, which describes  the  class  of  object  being searched for.
 For example if the target object  is  that  of  "Polonius  Plum", a
 person,  then  the  correct  associated  type  would  be  "Person".
 The currently displayed type can  be  changed by pressing 't' (note
 that the correct type must be selected BEFORE a value is  entered).

  Once a  value  has  been  entered  the  search  proper  will
 commence, returning a list of matching entries.
