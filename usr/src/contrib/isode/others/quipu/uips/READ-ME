[ READ-ME - Tue Jun 12 13:08:49 1990 - OSI Directory User Interfaces - /cwm ]

The user interfaces and instructions for build them are described in
READ-ME files in each of the directories.  It is anticipated that the
dish interface will have the broadest appeal.

You may generate all of the user interface programs by executing make
in this directory:

	% ./make

and then install them by executing make with the following parameter,

	% ./make install

If you do not want to clean up following the install you should use
the following command instead:

	% ./make inst-all
