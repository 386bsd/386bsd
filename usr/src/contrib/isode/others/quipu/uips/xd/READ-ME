Xd   - X-Directory
~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~

	Xd is a demonstration DUA that runs, as it's name suggests, under
	X-Windows. 
  
UNPACKING
~~~~~~~~~
        xd.tar.Z is a compressed tar file containing the xd src tree.
	If you want to build xd as part of the ISODE tree, change directory
	to others/quipu/uips before unpacking the archive.

	Unpack using:

	gnutar -x -f xd.tar.Z -z

	or

	uncompress -c xd.tar.Z | tar xfv -

	It should create a diretory called xd containing the following
	files:
	Makefile	README
	Xd.ad		calls.c
	conf_read.y	dirtitle.h
	filt.c		filt.h
	main.c		sequence.c
	sequence.h	symtab.c
	symtab.h	Xd.c
	make		make_alone
	Xd.1c

	Xd/duaconfig/filterTypes:
	Type_dept	Type_org
	Type_person	Type_place

	xd/duaconfig:
	readTypes	typeDefaults

	Xd/helpdir:
	xdlist.help	xdlookback.help
	xdtype.help	xd.help
	xdlistsel.help	xdsearch.help
	xdwiden.help



COMPILATION
~~~~~~~~~~~
	To compile, check the Makefile and make any alterations
	necessary for your site.  The Makefile assumes X is
	installed in the normal place (/usr/lib/). 
	If xd is being compiled as part of ISODE then the
	./make script should build the interface correctly.
	If it is being built separately then ./make_alone 
	should be used.
	
INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
	`./make install' should install in the standard places. 
	It should be possible to run xxd from the xd directory.

	NOTE: The application-defaults file is installed into
	/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults
	if this is not normal for your system, you must change
	the Makefile

CONFIGURATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The Xd.ad default resources must be loaded in order that
	xd knows where to position all its objects.  This can
	be achieved by typing:
	xrdb -load Xd.ad

	To avoid doing this at the beginning of every X session
	the defaults file Xd.ad can be copied into the application
	defaults directory for X under the name Xd.

	The widget hierarchy for xd is given below:


toplevel
  outer

    view_list
      list_area

    result_area

    commandform
      search_but
      list_but
      lookback_but
	popup
	  form
	    quit_but
	    list_places
      widen_but
