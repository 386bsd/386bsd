[ READ-ME - Wed Jan 16 10:14:24 1991 - dsc - /mtr ]

dsc is an interface to the X.500 Directory which was originally designed as
an X.29 public access interface for use at UCL.  It offers two modes of 
usage: easy and advanced.

The "easy" interface is a specially written dish (DIrectory SHell) script.

WARNING - It only runs on shells, such as the SUNOS Bourne shell, which
support functions.

It only searches within a single country - this was done to keep the number 
of questions and the format of the input as simple as possible.  
Clearly the interface could be tweaked to allow a wider scope of 
querying.  This script assumes that the dish binaries are already installed.  

The "advanced" interface is Brunel University's sd interface, which is
now available as part of the ISODE release.  Obviously another interface 
could be used if desired, although the help text would need to be rewritten.
This script assumes that the sd interface has already been installed.

If you are in the UK and would like to try the interface, it is available 
at ucl by calling uk.ac.ucl.dir, or 000005113200 for those in 
mnemonic-free zones.

Helpful comments on the script will be gratefully received.  (Note that an
enhanced version of this interface, written in C, is now under development.)

Comments should be sent to quipu-support@cs.ucl.ac.uk

Thanks are due to a number of people who made comments on the interface, and
in particular to Andy Powell of the University of Bath, who provided 
some code!

-----------

If you would like to port the interface, you first need to configure a few
things in the Makefile.

# the distinguished name of the "local" country (used by the easy interface)
CDN=c=GB

# the distinguished name of the "local" organisation (used by the easy
# interface)
ORGRDN=o=University College London

# the directory where the easy interface deposits some logs.  
# THIS DIRECTORY MUST BE CREATED
LOGPLACE=/u2/quipu/logs/dsc

# the directory where the dish binaries and sd may be found
LOCALPATH=/usr/local/bin

# the short form name of your organisation - this appears in some of the
# help text
SITESHORTNAME=UCL

# an "english" equivalent of the ORGDN - this is used in the help text
# maximum of about 30 chars
SITELONGNAME=GB, University College London

# if you want the interface to bind as a user, specify the name of the user
# here.  This is useful as it enables monitoring of the directory using this
# interface.  The double backslashes are important to protect the quotes.
# If you don't want the interface to bind as a user, set BINDARG as
# illustrated immediately below (sample entries for "dir" and "public access
# dua" are given in the files host and paa):
# BINDARG=
BINDARG=-u \\"@c=gb@o=university college london@cn=dir@cn=public access dua\\"

# Dou you want greybook order mailboxes?  Anything other than "yes" yields
# rfc822 order
EMAILUKORDER=yes

It also also possible to customise the appearance of telephone numbers.  At
UCL, local phone numbers are shown just as extensions.  UK numbers are
converted from the +44 format into leading 0 format.  If you wish to do
something similar at your site, produce a file containing an awk script
fragment comparable to that in the file "localphone.ucl", and call this 
file "localphone".

Then type:

make dsc

to configure the script ready for use.

make install

installs the dsc script in the $(LOCALPATH) directory.
