[ READ-ME - Fri Dec  9 21:59:43 1988 - "dish" Directory Interface - /cwm ]

This directory contains some additional features for the OSI Directory
Interface called "dish" which is build and installed from the
quipu/dish directory.  To generate these additional features you
should:

   ./make install

from this directory.  If you do not want to clean up after the install
you can issue the following command instead:

   ./make inst-all

The program "new_quipurc" is used to create a ".quipurc" file in users 
home directories.  If will only be called if the option
	quipurc on
is specified in the file /etc/dsaptailor.
ALSO to use this option, you should edit "./dishinit", and enter the
name of the manager, their password, and the users part of the 
local sub-tree, BEFORE you run make inst-all.
