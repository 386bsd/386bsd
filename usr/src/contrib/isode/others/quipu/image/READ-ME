    1.  Get a copy of ISODE 6.0 or later for your system.  Install it.


    2.  Bring-up the OSI Directory on one host in your site.  This host
    must run ISODE.  The other hosts need only run the programs in
    this directory.  Besides these programs, the others hosts will
    need a copy of the /usr/etc/isotailor file from the master host.


    3.  Go to the others/quipu/photo/ directory.  Make it and install
    it.  This will create a directory /usr/etc/g3fax/ which contains the
    fax decoding routines/databases needed by the image programs.


    3.  In this directory do "% ./make all" followed by "# ./make inst-all"


    4.  Get a copy of MH 6.5 or greater.  You don't need to do this if you are
    interested in running only xwho. 


    5.  Great, so you have everything in place except the images that
    the OSI Directory will provide.  How you get these images (which
    should be in g3fax bitmaps in ASN.1 bitstring format) is your problem.
    Typically, for the face agent 64x64 bitmaps are good.  One example
    is in the file "sk".

    Here's a suggestion.  One of the programs installed in /usr/etc/g3fax/
    is called pr2pe.  It will take a Sun raster file image and convert
    it to the desired format.  Invoke pr2pe thusly: 

	% /usr/etc/g3fax/pr2pe < rasterfile > faxfile

    The next thing you need to do is to add a photo attribute to the
    DN entry for each person you have a picture of.  For example, if my DN
    is

	c=US@o=DMD@cn=Marshall T. Rose

    Then, you edit the file

	/usr/etc/quipu/dsa/c=US/o=DMD/EDB

    and look for an entry that starts with

	cn=Marshall T. Rose

    you then add this line

	photo={FILE}

    You now do

	% cp faxfile /usr/etc/quipu/dsa/c=US/o=DMD/"cn=Marshall T. Rose".photo

    (Note the use of quotes to include the spaces in the filename!)

    Next, you re-start QUIPU.

    Repeat this step for all of the images of people you have.  If you
    don't control the DSA responsible for some person, then you need to
    contact the DSA administrator and get them to add the image for you.
    How they do this if they are running something other than a QUIPU
    DSA is your problem.

    6.  Usage tips:  when I start X, I use a shell script.  the first
    thing the script does is

	FACEPROC="`hostname` 6000" export FACEPROC

    then xinit is invoked.  When xterm starts under xinit, it runs
    another shell script that ends with: 

	exec xface -e -u

    By having the script exec xface, xface is run as a direct child of
    the xterm shell.  Hence, when this shell exits and the X server goes
    away, the -u switch will have xface exit as well.  


Good luck,
