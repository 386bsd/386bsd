[[ NOTE WELL: THE TP0BRIDGE IS BEING REMOVED FROM THE NEXT RELEASE OF
   THE ISODE -- USE THE TRANSPORT SERVICE BRIDGE INSTEAD ]]


    This program is used to bridge ISO TP0 packets between X.25 and TCP
    networks.  This technique is useful when interconnecting a DDN
    IP-based internet to an X.25-based subnetwork.  There is not a
    "magic bullet" solution to the DDN/ISO interoperability problem.
    Rather, if one is running higher-layer ISO protocols in both
    networks (namely ISO TP0), then a TP0 bridge can be used to achieve
    connectivity.  


    Configuration:

    On the host running the bridge, decide if you're using SUN_X25,
    CAMTEC, or UBC_X25 and define that in addition to X25 in your
    config.h file.  Next, the tailoring variable 

	x25_bridge_port

    should be set to the TCP port where the listens.  TCP port number
    146 has been officially assigned for this purpose, so you may wish
    to add the line

	tp0bridge	146/tcp

    to your /etc/services file.

    On the TCP hosts which will be using the bridge, define BRIDGE_X25
    in your config.h file.  Do not define X25 unless the TCP host also
    has its own X25 interface.  Next, the tailoring variable

	x25_bridge_host

    should be set to the domain name or DDN-IP address of the host which
    is running the bridge.  In addition, the tailoring variable 

	x25_bridge_addr

    should be set to the X.25 address that the TCP host is going to
    masquerade as (this is usually a subaddress of the X.25 address of
    the host running the bridge).

    Where a single set of binaries is to be shared by several hosts,
    or where the machine has access to two different X.25 networks,
    it is possible to define X25, one of the X25 interfaces, AND
    BRIDGE_X25.  This is convenient where a group of machines share
    binaries using NFS but only one of them has an X25 interface.  The
    tailoring variable

	x25_bridge_discrim

    may be used to determine which calls use the bridge and which use the
    X25 interface directly. If this is empty, the bridge will be used
    in all cases, if the string is a '-' then the bridge will not be
    used for any traffic, otherwise the string is compared against the
    called DTE. If the string is a prefix of the DTE, then the bridge
    will be used, otherwise it is assumed to be real X.25.

    Finally, the /etc/isoentities file should be updated to reflect the
    new X.25 addresses in use and this file should be propagated to all
    sites.
