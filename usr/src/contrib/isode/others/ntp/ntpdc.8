.SH NAME
ntpdc \- monitor operation of ntp daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBntpdc\fP [\fB-n\fP] [\fB-v\fP] \fIhosts...\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIntpdc\fP sends an INFO_QUERY packet to an ntp daemon running on the given
hosts.  Each daemon responds with information about each of its
peers, which \fIntpdc\fP formats on the standard output.
.PP
Normally, the name of the responding host and its peers are printed.
The \fB-n\fP switch disables this, printing only internet addresses.
.PP
Default is a terse, table-style report.
The \fB-v\fP switch generates a verbose report.

.SH TERSE REPORT
.PP
A typical terse report looks like:

.nf

.PP
Fields are interpreted as follows:
.TP
- or *:
The \fB-\fP mark indicates a pre-configured peer (mentioned in ntp.conf).
the \fB*\fP mark shows which pre-configured peer (if any) is currently
being used for synchronization.
.TP
(rem) address:
The remote host name or internet address of a peer.
.TP
(lcl) address:
The "local" host as specified as an argument to
\fIntpdc\fP.
.TP
Strat:
The stratum level of the peer (as perceived by the local host).
.TP
Poll:
Current polling interval in seconds for this peer.
.TP
Reach:
Octal value of a shift register indicating which responses were
received from the previous 8 polls to this peer (see RFC-????).
.TP
Delay:
Round-trip delay in milliseconds for this peer as of the latest poll.
.TP
Disp:
Current value of dispersion (see RFC-????) in milliseconds for this peer.

.SH VERBOSE REPORTS
.PP
When the \fB-v\fP flag is given a series of verbose reports are presented.
A typical one looks like this:

.nf
Neighbor address 128.4.0.6 port:123  local address 192.35.201.47
Reach: 0376 stratum: 1 poll int(HPI): 10 precision: -10

.PP
Fields are interpreted as follows:
.TP
Neighbor address...:
The address and port number of this neighbor, followed by the
local address.
.TP
Reach: \fInn\fP
Reachability in response to last 8 polls (octal value of shift register)
.TP
stratum: \fIn\fP
Stratum level.
.TP
poll interval: \fItime\fP
.TP
precision: \fInn\fP
The precision of this clock, given in seconds as a power of 2.  \fIe.g\fP A
clock derived from the power line frequency (60 Hz) has a precision of 1/60
second (about 2^-6) and would be indicated by a precision of -6.
.TP
Syn distance: 0
Synchronizing distance.  Always zero in the current implementation.
.TP
disp: \fInn\fP
Dispersion.
.TP
flags: \fInn\fP
.TP
leap: \fIflag\fP
The leap second indicator.  Non-zero if there is to be a leap second added
or subtracted at the new year.
.TP
Reference clock ID: [\fIaddress\fP]
.TP
timestamp: \fInn\fP
.TP
Poll interval: \fItime\fP
.TP
threshold: \fInn\fP
.TP
timer: \fInn\fP
.TP
send: \fInn\fP
The number of ntp packets sent to this neighbor.
.TP
received: \fInn\fP
The number of ntp packets received from this neighbor.
.TP
samples: \fInn\fP
.TP
Delay and Offset
The round-trip delay and clock offset for the last eight ntp packet
exchanges.  If there are fewer than eight valid samples, the delay field
will be zero.
.TP
delay: \fIavg-delay\fP offset: \fIavg-offset\fP dsp \fI???\fP
Average delay, offset, and dispersion calculated from the above samples.
