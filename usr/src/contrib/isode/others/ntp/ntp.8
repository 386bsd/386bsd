.TH NTP 8 "30 July 1988"
.SH NAME
ntp \- query an ntp clock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ntp
[-v] [-s] [-f]
.I hosts...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIntp\fP sends an ntp packet to the ntp daemon running on each of the given
hosts.  A daemon fills in fields of the ntp packet as per RFC-????
and sends the packet back.
\fIntp\fP then formats and prints the result on the standard output.
.PP
The default output shows the delay, offset, and date in
.I ctime()
format.
.PP
Options can reset the time of the local system clock.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-v
Verbose output, showing the full contents of received ntp packets,
plus caluclated offset, displacement, etc.
.TP
-s
Set system time-of-day clock.  Will only happen if time offset is
less than compiled-in constant WAYTOBIG (currently 1000 seconds).
Will not happen if remote host is unsynchronized.
.TP
-f
Force setting system clock regardless of offset.  Must be used with
.B -s
option.  Still will not reset clock if remote system is unsynchronized.
.SH NTP RESULTS
The default output for each
.I host
looks like this:
.in +4
.nf

The verbose output for each

looks like this:

The various fields are interpreted as follows:
.TP
Packet from: [\fIaddress\fP]
The address that this ntp packet was received from.
.TP
Leap indicator: \fIn\fP
The leap second indicator.  Non-zero if there is to be a leap second added
or subtracted at the new year.
.TP
Status: \fIn\fP
.TP
Stratum: \fIn\fP (\fIsource\fP)
The stratum of the clock in the NTP hierarchy, along with the source
of the clock, either
the name of a reference standard (such as WWVB or GOES) or the Internet
address of the clock that this clock is derived from.
.TP
Poll = \fIn\fP
The desired poll rate of the peer.
.TP
Precision = \fIexponent\fP (dec)
The claimed precision of the clock, in seconds.
.TP
Synchronizing Dist is \fI???\fP
.TP
Synchronizing Dispersion is \fI???\fP
.PP
The next five timestamps are given as NTP fixed-point values, in both
hexadecimal and \fIctime(3)\fP.
These are set either by this ntp process, or by the server we are quering.
.TP
Reference Timestamp is \fIhex-timestamp\fP  \fIctime string\fP
The last time the server clock was adjusted. (remote time)
.TP
Originate Timestamp is \fIhex-timestamp\fP  \fIctime string\f
When the ntp request was transmitted by us to the server.  (local time)
.TP
Receive Timestamp is   \fIhex-timestamp\fP  \fIctime string\fP
When the ntp request was received at the server.  (remote time)
.TP
Transmit Timestamp is  \fIhex-timestamp\fP  \fIctime string\fP
When the ntp response was transmitted by the server.  (remote time)
.TP
Input Timestamp is     \fIhex-timestamp\fP  \fIctime string\fP
When the ntp response was received by us.  (local time)
.TP
\fIhostname\fP: delay:\fItime\fP offset:\fItime\fP
The summary of the results of the query, giving the hostname of the
responding clock (from the command line), the round-trip delay, and the
offset between the two clocks (assuming symmetric round-trip times).

.SH BUGS
Using
.I ntp
with the current host will show inaccurate results.
.PP
Probably a few others.  Report bugs to Louis A. Mamokos (louie@trantor.umd.edu).
