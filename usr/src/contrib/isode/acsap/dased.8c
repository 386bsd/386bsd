.SH NAME
dased \- stand-alone DASE
.SH SYNOPSIS
.in +.5i
.ti -.6i
.B \*(SDdased
\%[\-d]

\%[\-c\0DSA-name-or-address]
\%[\-u\0username] \%[\-p\0password]
.in -.5i
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIdased\fR program is used as a name/address resolver for the ISODE.
If the tailoring option \fIns_enable\fR is \*(lqon\*(rq,
then ISODE programs may contact \fIdased\fR to map service
descriptions into Distinguished Names and Presentation Addresses.
.PP
The \fIns_address\fR tailoring option indicates the transport address
which \fIdased\fR should listen on.
This may be overriden with the `\-a' option.
.PP
Note that unlike previous versions of the nameservice,
\fIdased\fR uses the OSI CO-mode transport service as backing.
As such,
any valid OSI transport address may be used for listening.
.PP
By default,
\fIdased\fR will use non-authentication when binding to the Directory.
If desired,
a username (DN) and a password can be supplied using the `\-u' and `\-p'
switches can be used (respectively).
Further,
\fIdased\fR will connect to the default local DSA
(the first entry in the \fIdsaptailor\fR file).
If desired,
the name or address of another DSA can be suppoed using the `\-c' switch.
.SH "DEBUG OPERATION"
If \fIdased\fR is started interactively,
or if the `\-d' switch is given,
then debug mode is entered.
In this case,
all logging activity is displayed on the user's terminal,
the logging information is more verbose,
and \fIdased\fR will terminate after it handles the first incoming connection
(this allows \fIdased\fR to be run under a debugger).
