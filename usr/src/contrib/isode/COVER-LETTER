    The next release of the "ISO Development Environment" will be
    available on 24 January 1990.  This release is called

				   ISODE 6.0

    This software supports the development of certain kinds of OSI protocols
    and applications.  Here are the details: 

  - The ISODE is not proprietary, but it is not in the public domain.  This was
    necessary to include a "hold harmless" clause in the release.  The upshot
    of all this is that anyone can get a copy of the release and do anything
    they want with it, but no one takes any responsibility whatsoever for any
    (mis)use.

  - The ISODE runs on native Berkeley (4.2, 4.3) and AT&T (SVR2, SVR3) systems,
    in addition to various other UNIX-like operating systems.  No kernel
    modifications are required.

  - Current modules include:
	OSI transport service (TP0 on top of TCP and X.25; TP4 for SunLink OSI)
	OSI session, presentation, and association control services
	ASN.1 abstract syntax/transfer notation tools, including:
	    remote operations stub-generator (front-end for remote operations)
	    structure-generator (ASN.1 to C)
	    element-parser (basic encoding rules)
	OSI reliable transfer and remote operations services
	OSI file transfer, access and management
	FTAM/FTP gateway
	OSI directory services
	OSI virtual terminal (basic class, TELNET profile)

  - ISODE 6.0 consists of final "IS" level implementations with a few
    exceptions: ROSE and RTSE are current to the last circulated drafts
    (March, 1988); VT is a DIS implementation.  The ISODE also contains
    implementations of the 1984 X.400 versions of ROS and RTS.

  - Although the ISODE is not "supported" per se, it does have a problem
    reporting address, Bug-ISODE@NISC.PSI.NET.  Bug reports (and fixes) are
    welcome by the way. 

  - The discussion group ISODE@NIC.DDN.MIL is used as an open forum on ISODE.
    Contact ISODE-Request@NIC.DDN.MIL to be added to this list.

  - The primary documentation for this release consists of a five volume
    User's Manual (approx. 1000 pages) and a set of UNIX manual pages.  The
    sources to the User's Manual are in LaTeX format.  In addition, there are
    a number of notes, papers, and presentations included in the documentation
    set, again in either LaTeX or SLiTeX format.  If you do not have LaTeX, you
    should probably get a hardcopy from one of the distribution sites below.








    DISTRIBUTION SITES

 1. FTP
    If you can FTP to the Internet, then use anonymous FTP to uu.psi.com
    [136.161.128.3] to retrieve the file isode-6.tar.Z in BINARY mode from the
    isode/ directory.  This file is the tar image after being run through
    the compress program and is approximately 4.5MB in size.

 2. NIFTP
    If you run NIFTP over the public X.25 or over JANET, and are registered in
    the NRS at Salford, you can use NIFTP with username "guest" and your own
    name as password, to access UK.AC.UCL.CS to retrieve the file
    <SRC>isode-6.tar.  This is a 14MB tar image.  The file <SRC>isode-6.tar.Z
    is the tar image after being run through the compress program (4.5MB).
