.SH NAME
.B isoservices
\- ISODE services database
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIisoservices\fR
file contains information regarding the known services on the host.
.PP
\fBNB\0\fR: Use of this database is deprecated.
Consult the ISODE \fIUser's Manual\fR for further information.
.PP
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.
However, double\-quotes may be used to prevent separation between arguments
in the vector.
The character `#' at the beginning of a line indicates a comment line.
.PP
Each line consists of the name of the provider, a slash, and the name of the
entity residing above the provider;
the selector used to identify the entity to the provider;
and,
the program and argument vector to \fIexecvp\fR when the service is requested.
If the selector starts with a hash\-mark (`#')
it is interpreted numerically as a decimal short-word quantity;
otherwise if it appears in double\-quotes,
it is interpreted as an ascii string,
with the usual escape mechanisms for introducing non\-printable characters;
otherwise,
it is interpreted as an exploded octet string.
