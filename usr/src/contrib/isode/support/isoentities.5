.SH NAME
.B isoentities
\- ISODE entities database
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIisoentities\fR file contains information regarding the known
application-entity titles (AETs).
This file is used by the stub\-directory service in ISODE.
.PP
\fBNB\0\fR: Use of this database is deprecated.
Consult the ISODE \fIUser's Manual\fR for further information.
.PP
Entries are separated by blank lines (or the end\-of\-file).
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters,
though double\-quotes may be used to prevent separation between arguments.
The character `#' at the beginning of a line indicates a comment line.
.PP
Each entry consists of four items:
the first two,
the designator and qualifier,
for the object descriptor of the application-entity information
(the distinguished designator \*(lqdefault\*(rq is used for a template entry);
the third item is the object identifier of application-entity
information in dot-notation
(if no application-entity information is desired the string
\*(lqNULL\*(rq should be used instead);
and the fourth item is  the entire presentation address expressed using
the ISODE string format.
Note that since double-quotes are often used in the new string format,
it is \fBvery\fR important to quote them correctly in the
\fIisoentities\fR file.
Usually preceeding the first character of the address with single backslash
is adequate.
.PP
It is suggested for readability purposes that a blank line should
seperate entries.
.PP
Note that this database is used by the stub-directory service in ISODE.
A real directory uses an entirely different mechanism for resolving lookups.
The stub-directory mechanism in ISODE transforms the internal AET
notion (the object identifiers) into one which appears to have come
from a real directory (i.e., application-entity information).
.SH "RFC1085 SUPPORT"
Since applications using RFC1085 (the lightweight presentation protocol)
usually demultiplex on the basis of TCP or UDP port,
a further definition for the qualifier is placed in
\fI/etc/services\fR,
one of:
.sp
.in +.5i
.nf
qualifier    portno/lpp
qualifier    portno/tcp
qualifier    portno/udp
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp
The first alternative says that the service lives on both TCP and UD;
the second alternative says that the service lives on TCP only;
and,
the third alternative says that the service lives on UDP only.
