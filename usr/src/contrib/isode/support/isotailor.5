.SH NAME
.B isotailor
\- ISODE tailoring file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIisotailor\fR file contains information used to run-time
configure the ISODE distribution.
Entries are separated by end\-of\-line (or the end\-of\-file).
The character `#' at the beginning of a line indicates a comment line.
The syntax is:
.sp
.in +.5i
.nf
variable: value
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp
as in
.sp
.in +.5i
.nf
sbindir: /usr/etc/
.fi
.in -.5i
.PP
The entries come in several types. There are general ISODE
configuration parameters, operating system specific tailoring and
interface specific tailoring parameters.
.SH "LOCAL ENVIRONMENT TAILORING"
There are some variables that are used to make up for deficiencies in
operating systems, or to override the operating system. These are
described as follows.
.IP localname
This takes a string as a parameter and is used as
the name of the local host if the \fIgethostname\fR call
(or equivalent, e.g., \fIuname\fR)
is not used. This will also override any other run-time determination
of the local hostname.
.IP binpath
This takes a string as a parameter and indicates the directory where
the ISODE user programs are kept (be sure to use a trailing slash).
.IP sbinpath
This takes a string as a parameter and indicates the directory where
the ISODE system programs are kept (be sure to use a trailing slash).
.IP etcpath
This takes a string as a parameter and indicates the directory where
the ISODE configuration files are kept (be sure to use a trailing slash).
.SH "LOGGING TAILORING"
There are a number of options that can be set for each layer of ISODE.
The first variable indicates the default logging directory,
the other variables give information about each log file.
.IP logpath
This variable takes a string as a parameter and indicates the
directory where the ISODE log files are kept (be sure to use a
trailing slash). 
.PP
The remaining variables are all configured in the same way and are in
the general format:
.sp
.in +.5i
.nf
xyzlevel: [none] [exceptions] [notice] [pdus] [trace] [debug] [all]
xyzfile: filename
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp
The filename can be either the name of a file of a `\-' in which case
the standard error is used. If the filename contains the string `%d'
then this is replaced by the current process id.
.PP
The normal level for this style of tailoring is to set exceptions. The
other two values can be added in when debugging, if so desired.
The current variables in this format are as follows.
.sp
.in +.5i
.nf
.ta \w'compatlevel  'u
compatlevel	native services subsystem
compatfile
addrlevel	addressing subsystem
addrfile
tsaplevel	transport level
tsapfile
ssaplevel	session level
ssapfile
psaplevel	presentation elements
psapfile
psap2level	presentation level
psap2file
acsaplevel	association control level
acsapfile
rtsaplevel	reliable transfer level
rtsapfile
rosaplevel	remote operations level
rosapfile
.sp
.in -.5i
.fi
.SH "TRANSPORT STACK TAILORING"
There are several variables which can be used to en/disable configured
TS-stacks and to define OSI communities and their relationship
to this system.
.SS "TS-STACKS"
.IP ts_stacks
which takes one or more of the following values:
.sp
.in +.5i
.nf
[tcp] [x25] [bridge] [tp4] [all]
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp
indicates which TS-stacks should be enabled.
This is useful when multiple machines (with different interfaces)
share the same executables.
For example,
the \fB\*(EDisotailor\fR file is a normally symbolic link to
\fB/private\*(EDisotailor\fR.
.SS "OSI COMMUNITIES"
.IP ts_interim
which takes one or more OSI community names as a value.
Each community name must be defined as a macro in the
\fIisomacros\fR\0(5) file.
.IP ts_communities
which takes one or more of the following values:
.sp
.in +.5i
.nf
[int-x25] [janet] [internet] [realns] [localTCP] [all]
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp
This variable is used to distinguish membership in various OSI communities.
For example,
a site with an X.25 connection might be attached to the International X.25
network, but not the JANET.
Thus \fIts_stacks\fR would include \*(lqx25\*(rq,
and \fIts_communities\fR would include \*(lqint-x25\*(rq but not
\*(lqjanet\*(rq.
Note that the ordering of communities is important:
network addresses will be tried in the order that their respective
communities are listed with this variable.
.IP default_nsap_community
which takes an integer value,
declaring the default community to be used for NSAP addresses.
.IP default_x25_community
declaring the default community to be used for X.25 (DTE) addresses.
.IP default_tcp_community
declaring the default community to be used for TCP (RFC1006) addresses.
.SS "TS-BRIDGE"
These are the parameters that are used in the Transport-Service Bridge
implementation.
.IP tsb_communities
A list of pairs of values.
The first of each value should be a community as defined in the
\fIts_communities\fP variable
(obviously the values \*(lqnone\*(rq and \*(lqall\*(rq are not permissible).
The second value of the pair should be a presentation address using
the ISODE \*(lqstring\*(rq format.
When a call is to be placed and the network corresponds to one
of the communities given here, then a call through the bridge given in
the second variable will be made automatically.
.IP tsb_default_address
This variable contains a string encoded presentation address which the
bridge will listen on by default.
This should normally consist of a set of network addresses with no selectors
present.
.PP
Consider the case of a host with access to both the Internet and the
International X.25 network.
This host might have this entry in its \fIisotailor\fR file:
.sp
.in +.5i
.nf
tsb_default_address: Internet=sheriff+17004\\|Int-X25(80)=23426020017299+PID+03018000
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp
This tells the bridge to listen on two network endpoints.
Hosts in the Internet community wishing to reach the International
X.25 community would have this entry in their \fIisotailor\fR file:
.sp
.in +.5i
.nf
tsb_communities: int-x25 Internet=sheriff+17004
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp
Similarly,
hosts in the International X.25 community wishing to reach the
Internet community, would have the entry:
.sp
.in +.5i
.nf
tsb_communities: internet Int-X25(80)=23426020017299+PID+03018000
.fi
.in -.5i
.SH "INTERFACE SPECIFIC TAILORING"
Most interfaces that ISODE runs over have some form of tailoring.
These are usually very dependent on the interface. Each interface
which supports tailoring will now be described.
.SS "General X.25 Tailoring"
There are two specific variables that can be used with any X.25
interface.
.IP x25_local_dte
This is the X.121 address that ISODE processes will listen on
by default.
It may be a full X.121 address or a sub-address.
.IP x25_local_pid
This is the X.25 protocol ID that ISODE processes will listen on by default.
Traditionally, this is the first four octets of the CUDF in hex-notation,
e.g., 03010100.
.PP
There are also three variables for performing address
manipulation as required by some network vendors.
.IP x25_intl_zero
If this has the value `on' then any international DTEs (i.e.
having non\-local DNICs) will have a leading zero introduced
before being passed to the network.
.IP x25_strip_dnic
If this has the value `on' then any local DTEs (i.e. having the
local DNIC) will have this DNIC removed before being passed to
the network.
.IP x25_dnic_prefix
This should be set to the local DNIC (the first four digits of the
DTE) of the host machine.
It should only be set if one or both of the previous two
variables has the value `on'.
.PP
There are also two variables for logging X.25 statistics.
.IP x25level
Defines the level of logging to be used for X.25 statistics logging.
(At present, only \*(lqnotice\*(rq level messages are generated.)
.IP x25file
Defines the filename to be used for X.25 statistics logging.
.SS "SUNLINK X.25"
These setting are only useful when SUN_X25 is defined along with X25.
The effect of these parameters is more fully documented in the Sun manuals.
.IP reverse_charge
Set to 1 or 0 to enable/disable reverse charging.
.IP recvpktsize
.IP sendpktsize
This should be set to one of 0 (default), 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 or
1024 to set the send/receive packet size.
.IP recvwndsize
.IP sendwndsize
This sets the send/receive window sizes. Legal values are 0 (default),
7 and 127.
.IP recvthruput
.IP sendthruput
This sets the sending/receiving throughput values. Legal values are 0
(default) 75, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 48000.
.IP cug_req
Closed user group request. Set to either 0 or 1.
.IP cug_index
Sets the closed user group index number.
.IP fast_select_type
Sets the fast select parameters. Either 0, 1 or 2.
.IP rpoa_req
.IP rpoa
Recognised private operating agency parameters.
.SS "CAMTEC CCL"
These are used
when the Camtec X.25 is accessed via the
CCL (sockets) mechanism.
.IP x25_outgoing_port
This selects which port on the Camtec card will be used
for outgoing calls, and takes the value A, B or #.
A and B are the two X.21 WAN interfaces and # is the
Ethernet.
Listening is automatically done on all three ports.
.SS "BRIDGE X.25"
These are parameters that are used in the tp0bridge implementation.
.IP x25_bridge_host
The host machine that is running the tp0bridge.
.IP x25_bridge_port
This is the TCP port that is to be used
for bridging.
The default is 146, which should be in defined in /etc/services.
.IP x25_bridge_addr
The X.121 address of the remote host.
.IP x25_bridge_listen
The X.121 address to listen on for incoming calls, on the remote host.
.IP x25_bridge_pid
The protocol ID used for listening along with the previous address.
This is encoded as a string of eight hex digits.
.IP x25_bridge_discrim
A string used to discriminate the network. When attempting to place an
X.25 call with BRIDGE_X25 and real X25 configured in, this string is
used to decide which interface to use. If the string is empty, the
bridge will be used. If it is set to `\-' the bridge will not be used.
If the string is anything else, it is compared against the called
X.121 address. If there is a match, then the bridge is used, otherwise
the real interface is used.
.SH "SESSION SERVICES TAILORING"
Ther are three variables that can be tailored:
.IP ses_abort_timer
The number of seconds to drain on session aborts.
.IP ses_disconnect_timer
The number of seconds to drain on session disconnects.
.IP ses_refuse_timer
The number of seconds to drain on session refuses.
.SH "DIRECTORY SERVICES TAILORING"
There are two variables that can be tailored:
.IP ns_enable
This takes either the string \*(lqon\*(rq or \*(lqoff\*(rq as a parameter.
If \*(lqon\*(rq,
then the \*(lquser-friendly namservice" will be used to perform
name/address resolution.
If the nameservice lookup fails,
the stub-directory will be used as a fallback.
.IP ns_address
This is the transport address of the nameservice.
It is specified using the ISODE \*(lqstring\*(rq format,
e.g.,
.in +.5i
Internet=wp.psi.net+17006
.in -.5i
which indicates that the nameservice lives in the TCP/IP communications domain
on TCP port \*(lq17006\*(rq at host \*(lqwp.psi.net\*(rq.
The nameservice is accessed via the OSI CO-mode transport service,
so other kinds of addresses (e.g., X.25 addresses can be used as well).
.SH "PROGRAM-SPECIFIC TAILORING"
By default
a program-specific tailoring file is consulted before the system\-wide
tailoring file.
The program-specific file is called \fB\&.myname_tailor\fR in the user's
home directory,
where \*(lqmyname\*(rq is the name that the program was invoked with.
.SH FILES
