.TH DIRENT 4 "Standard Extension"
.SH NAME
dirent \- file system independent directory entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <sys/types.h>"
.br
.B "#include <isode/sys.dirent.h>"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Different file system types
may have different directory entries.
The
.I dirent
structure defines a
file system independent directory entry,
which contains information common to
directory entries in different file system types.
A set of these structures is returned by the
.IR getdents (2)
system call.
.P
The
.I dirent
structure is defined below.
.sp
struct	dirent	{
.br
			long			d_ino;
.br
			off_t			d_off;
.br
			unsigned short		d_reclen;
.br
			char			d_name[1];
.br
		};
.P
.sp
The field
.I d_ino
is a number which is unique
for each file in the file system.
The field
.I d_off\^
represents an offset of that directory entry
in the actual file system directory.
The field
.I d_name
is the beginning of the character array
giving the name of the directory entry.
This name is null terminated
and may have at most
.SM NAME_MAX
characters in addition to the null terminator.
This results in file system independent directory entries
being variable-length entities.
The value of
.I d_reclen
is the record length of this entry.
This length is defined to be the number of bytes
between the beginning of the current entry and the next one,
adjusted so that the next entry
will start on a long boundary.

.SH WARNING
The field
.I d_off\^
does not have a simple interpretation
for some file system types
and should not be used directly by applications.
