     There are a number of 386BSD  special  interest  groups
forming, focussing on topics of interest to the research and
development community.	Among these areas of interest are:

*    Shared Libraries

*    Filesystems

*    Symmetric Multiprocessing

*    Windowing Systems

*    Virtual Memory System

*    Gigabit Networking

In addition, a	number	of  smaller  projects  focussing  on
improvements  in the kernel and utilities are getting under-
way.

     If you are interested in learning about  any  of  these
groups,	or you would like to form your own SIG, please fill
out and send in this REGISTRATION form and we will  put	you
on the SIG mailing list (along with the general 386BSD mail-
ing list) and  help  you  form	contacts  with	other  users
interested in discussing these topics.

     386BSD is intended by the developer to be used for edu-
cational  and  research	purposes. As such, the developer of
this release is making	it  available  to  the	user  at  no
charge,	in  order  to	encourage  and facilitate its use in
research and education.	However, 386BSD has been  a  costly
product	to  develop and maintain, and each release consumes
enormous resources.

     Release  0.0,  the	first	complete  freely   available
release of BSD for the 386/486 PC, was completed entirely as
a personal project.  386BSD Release 0.1, the second  release
of  a complete 386BSD system, was motivated primarily due to
the enthusiasm and contributions of  the  Release  0.0	user
base.

     In sum, 386BSD has taken over four	years	of  personal
financing on the part of the developers to get it out to the
user.  Unfortunately, we are  not  funded  by  any  granting
agency, university, corporation, or non-profit company.

     If you like 386BSD, you may elect to make	a  contribu-
tion  to  defray  the cost of development and to demonstrate
support of this project.  If just 10% of the number of	peo-
ple using 386BSD out there right now sent in $100 each, this
project would be adequately funded for the next two years!

     Should you with to make  a	contribution,	return	this
form with your check or money order (suggested contribution:
$50.00US binary and $100.00US source) made out to:
