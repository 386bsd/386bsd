rmdir \- remove empty directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rmdir
[\-p] [\-\-path] dir...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR rmdir .
.B rmdir
removes each given empty directory.  If any non-option argument
does not refer to an existing empty directory, it is an error.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-p, \-\-path"
Remove any parent directories that are explicitly mentioned in an
argument, if they become empty after the argument file is removed.
.PP
The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as `\-\-',
for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually support for `+'
will be removed, because it is incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
