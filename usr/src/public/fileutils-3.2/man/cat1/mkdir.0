       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU  version of mmkkddiirr.
       mmkkddiirr creates  a  directory  with  each  given  name.   By
       default, the mode of created directories is 0777 minus the
       bits set in the umask.

       -_m, --_m_o_d_e _m_o_d_e
              Set the mode of created directories to _m_o_d_e,  which
              is  symbolic  as in chmod and uses the default mode
              as the point of departure.

       -_p, --_p_a_t_h
              Ensure that each given path exists.  Make any miss-
              ing  parent  directories for each argument.  Parent
              directories  default  to  the  umask  modified   by
              `u+wx'.  Do not consider an argument directory that
              already exists to be an error.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
