       This manual page documents the  GNU  version  of  iinnssttaallll.
       iinnssttaallll  copies files and sets their permission modes and,
       if possible, their owner and group.  Used similarly to ccpp;
       typically  used  in  Makefiles to copy programs into their
       destination directories.  It can also be  used  to  create
       the  destination  directories and any leading directories,
       and to set the final directory's  modes.   It  refuses  to
       copy files onto themselves.

       -_c     Ignored;  for  compatibility with old Unix versions
              of install.

       -_d, --_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Create each given directory and its leading  direc-
              tories,  if  they  do  not  already exist.  Set the
              owner, group and mode as given on the command  line
              or  to the defaults.  Also gives any leading direc-
              tories that are created those attributes.  This  is
              different  from  the SunOS 4.x _i_n_s_t_a_l_l, which gives
              directories that it creates the default attributes.

       -_g, --_g_r_o_u_p _g_r_o_u_p
              Set  the  group  ownership of the installed file or
              directory to the group ID of _g_r_o_u_p (default is pro-
              cess's current group).  _g_r_o_u_p may also be a numeric
              group ID.

       -_m, --_m_o_d_e _m_o_d_e
              Set the permission mode for the installed  file  or
              directory  to  _m_o_d_e,  which  can be either an octal
              number, or a symbolic mode as in chmod, with  0  as
              the  point of departure.  The default mode is 0755.

       -_o, --_o_w_n_e_r _o_w_n_e_r
              If run as root, set the ownership of the  installed
              file  to  the  user  ID of _o_w_n_e_r (default is root).
              _o_w_n_e_r may also be a numeric user ID.

       -_s, --_s_t_r_i_p
              Strip the symbol tables from installed programs.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
