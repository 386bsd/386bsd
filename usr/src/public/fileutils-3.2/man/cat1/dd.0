       This manual page documents the  GNU  version  of  dddd.   dddd
       copies  a  file  (from  the standard input to the standard
       output, by  default)  with  a  user-selectable  blocksize,
       while optionally performing conversions on it.

       Numbers can be followed by a multiplier:
       b=512, k=1024, w=2, xm=number m

       _i_f=_f_i_l_e
              Read from _f_i_l_e instead of the standard input.

       _o_f=_f_i_l_e
              Write  to  _f_i_l_e  instead  of  the  standard output.
              Unless _c_o_n_v=_n_o_t_r_u_n_c is given, truncate _f_i_l_e to  the
              size  specified  by  _s_e_e_k= (0 bytes if _s_e_e_k= is not
              given).

       _i_b_s=_b_y_t_e_s
              Read _b_y_t_e_s bytes at a time.

       _o_b_s=_b_y_t_e_s
              Write _b_y_t_e_s bytes at a time.

       _b_s=_b_y_t_e_s
              Read and write _b_y_t_e_s bytes at atime.  Override  ibs
              and obs.

       _c_b_s=_b_y_t_e_s
              Convert _b_y_t_e_s bytes at a time.

       _s_k_i_p=_b_l_o_c_k_s
              Skip _b_l_o_c_k_s ibs-sized blocks at start of input.

       _s_e_e_k=_b_l_o_c_k_s
              Skip _b_l_o_c_k_s obs-sized blocks at start of output.

       _c_o_u_n_t=_b_l_o_c_k_s
              Copy only _b_l_o_c_k_s ibs-sized input blocks.

       _c_o_n_v=_c_o_n_v_e_r_s_i_o_n[,_c_o_n_v_e_r_s_i_o_n...]
              Convert  the  file  as  specified by the _c_o_n_v_e_r_s_i_o_n
              arguments.

              ascii  Convert EBCDIC to ASCII.

              ebcdic Convert ASCII to EBCDIC.

              ibm    Convert ASCII to alternate EBCDIC.

              block  Pad newline-terminated records  to  size  of
                     cbs, replacing newline with trailing spaces.

              unblock
                     Replace trailing spaces in  cbs-sized  block
                     with newline.

              lcase  Change uppercase characters to lowercase.

              ucase  Change lowercase characters to uppercase.

              swab   Swap  every pair of input bytes.  Unlike the
                     Unix dd, this works when an  odd  number  of
                     bytes  are read.  If the input file contains
                     an odd number of bytes,  the  last  byte  is
                     simply  copied  (since  there  is nothing to
                     swap it with).

              noerror
                     Continue after read errors.

              sync   Pad every input block to size  of  ibs  with
                     trailing NULs.
