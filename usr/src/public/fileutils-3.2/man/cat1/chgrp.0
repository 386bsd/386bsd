       cchhggrrpp  changes  the  group ownership of each given file to
       the named group, which can be either a  group  name  or  a
       numeric group ID.

              ally changes.

       -_f, --_s_i_l_e_n_t, --_q_u_i_e_t
              Do not print error messages about files whose  own-
              ership cannot be changed.

       -_v, --_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
              Verbosely describe ownership changes.

       -_R, --_r_e_c_u_r_s_i_v_e
              Recursively  change  ownership  of  directories and
              their contents.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
