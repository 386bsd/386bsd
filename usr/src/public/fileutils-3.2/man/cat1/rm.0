       This manual page documents the  GNU  version  of  rrmm.   rrmm
       removes  each  given file.  By default, it does not remove
       directories.

       If a file is unwritable, the standard input is a tty,  and
       the -_f or --_f_o_r_c_e option is not given, rrmm prompts the user
       for whether to remove the file.  If the response does  not
       begin with `y' or `Y', the file is skipped.

       GNU  rrmm,  like every program that uses the getopt function
       to parse its arguments, lets you  use  the  --  option  to
       indicate that all following arguments are non-options.  To
       remove a file called `-f' in the  current  directory,  you
       could type either
              rm -- -f
       or
              rm ./-f
       The Unix rrmm program's use of a single `-' for this purpose
       predates the development of the getopt standard syntax.

       -_d, --_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Remove  directories  with   `unlink'   instead   of
              `rmdir',  and don't require a directory to be empty
              before trying to unlink it.   Only  works  for  the
              super-user.   Because  unlinking a directory causes
              any files in the deleted directory to become unref-
              erenced,  it  is  wise to ffsscckk the filesystem after
              doing this.

       -_f, --_f_o_r_c_e
              Ignore nonexistent files and never prompt the user.

       -_i, --_i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e
              Prompt   whether  to  remove  each  file.   If  the
              response does not begin with `y' or `Y',  the  file
              is skipped.

       -_r, -_R, --_r_e_c_u_r_s_i_v_e
              Remove the contents of directories recursively.

       -_v, --_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
              Print the name of each file before removing it.

       The  long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well
       as  `--',  for  compatibility  with   previous   releases.

       Eventually  support for `+' will be removed, because it is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
