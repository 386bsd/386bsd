       This manual page documents the GNU version of llss.  ddiirr and
       vvddiirr are versions of llss with different default output for-
       mats.  These programs list each given  file  or  directory
       path.   Directory contents are sorted alphabetically.  For
       llss, files are by default listed in columns, sorted  verti-
       cally,  if  the  standard  output is a terminal; otherwise
       they are listed one per  line.   For  ddiirr,  files  are  by
       default  listed  in columns, sorted vertically.  For vvddiirr,
       files are by default listed in long format.

       -_a, --_a_l_l
              List all files in directories, including all  files
              that start with `.'.

       -_b, --_e_s_c_a_p_e
              Quote  nongraphic  characters  in  file names using
              alphabetic and octal backslash sequences like those
              used in C.

       -_c, --_t_i_m_e=_c_t_i_m_e, --_t_i_m_e=_s_t_a_t_u_s
              Sort  directory  contents  according  to the files'
              status change  time  instead  of  the  modification
              time.   If  the  long listing format is being used,
              print the status change time instead of the modifi-
              cation time.

       -_d, --_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              List  directories  like  other  files,  rather than
              listing their contents.

       -_g     Ignored; for Unix compatibility.

       -_i, --_i_n_o_d_e
              Print the index number of each file to the left  of
              the file name.





                                                                1

       -_k, --_k_i_l_o_b_y_t_e_s
              If file sizes are being listed, print them in kilo-
              bytes.  This  overrides  the  environment  variable
              POSIXLY_CORRECT.

       -_l, --_f_o_r_m_a_t=_l_o_n_g, --_f_o_r_m_a_t=_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
              In  addition  to  the  name of each file, print the
              file type, permissions, number of hard links, owner
              name, group name, size in bytes, and timestamp (the
              modification time unless other times are selected).
              For  files  with  a time that is more than 6 months
              old or more than 1 hour into the future, the times-
              tamp  contains the year instead of the time of day.

       -_m, --_f_o_r_m_a_t=_c_o_m_m_a_s
              List files horizontally, with as many as  will  fit
              on each line, separated by commas.

       -_n, --_n_u_m_e_r_i_c-_u_i_d-_g_i_d
              List  the numeric UID and GID instead of the names.

       -_p     Append a character to each file name indicating the
              file type.

       -_q, --_h_i_d_e-_c_o_n_t_r_o_l-_c_h_a_r_s
              Print  question marks instead of nongraphic charac-
              ters in file names.

       -_r, --_r_e_v_e_r_s_e
              Sort directory contents in reverse order.

       -_s, --_s_i_z_e
              Print the size of each file in  1K  blocks  to  the
              left of the file name.  If the environment variable
              POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, 512-byte  blocks  are  used
              instead.

       -_t, --_s_o_r_t=_t_i_m_e
              Sort  directory  contents  by  timestamp instead of
              alphabetically, with the newest files listed first.

       -_u, --_t_i_m_e=_a_t_i_m_e, --_t_i_m_e=_a_c_c_e_s_s, --_t_i_m_e=_u_s_e
              Sort  directory  contents  according  to the files'
              last access time instead of the modification  time.
              If the long listing format is being used, print the
              last access time instead of the modification  time.

       -_x, --_f_o_r_m_a_t=_a_c_r_o_s_s, --_f_o_r_m_a_t=_h_o_r_i_z_o_n_t_a_l
              List the files in columns, sorted horizontally.

       -_A, --_a_l_m_o_s_t-_a_l_l
              List  all  files  in directories except for `.' and
              `..'.




                                                                2

       -_B, --_i_g_n_o_r_e-_b_a_c_k_u_p_s
              Do not list files that end with  `~',  unless  they
              are given on the command line.

       -_C, --_f_o_r_m_a_t=_v_e_r_t_i_c_a_l
              List files in columns, sorted vertically.

       -_F, --_c_l_a_s_s_i_f_y
              Append a character to each file name indicating the
              file type.  For regular files that are  executable,
              append a `*'.  The file type indicators are `/' for
              directories, `@' for symbolic links, `|' for FIFOs,
              `=' for sockets, and nothing for regular files.

       -_L, --_d_e_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              List  the files linked to by symbolic links instead
              of listing the contents of the links.

       -_N, --_l_i_t_e_r_a_l
              Do not quote file names.

       -_Q, --_q_u_o_t_e-_n_a_m_e
              Enclose file names in double quotes and quote  non-
              graphic characters as in C.

       -_R, --_r_e_c_u_r_s_i_v_e
              List the contents of all directories recursively.

       -_S, --_s_o_r_t=_s_i_z_e
              Sort  directory  contents  by  file size instead of
              alaphabetically,  with  the  largest  files  listed
              first.

       -_U, --_s_o_r_t=_n_o_n_e
              Do not sort directory contennts.

       -_X, --_s_o_r_t=_e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n
              Sort  directory  contents  alphabetically  by  file
              extension (characters after the  last  `.');  files
              with no extension are sorted first.

       -_1, --_f_o_r_m_a_t=_s_i_n_g_l_e-_c_o_l_u_m_n
              List one file per line.

       -_w, --_w_i_d_t_h _c_o_l_s
              Assume  the  screen  is  _c_o_l_s  columns  wide.   The
              default is taken from the terminal driver if possi-
              ble;  otherwise the environment variable CCOOLLUUMMNNSS is
              used if it is set; otherwise the default is 80.

       -_T, --_t_a_b_s_i_z_e _c_o_l_s
              Assume that each tabstop is _c_o_l_s columns wide.  The
              default is 8.

       -_I, --_i_g_n_o_r_e _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Do  not list files whose names match the shell pat-
              tern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n unless they are given on  the  command
              line.   As  in the shell, an initial `.' in a file-
              name does not match a wildcard at the start of _p_a_t-
              _t_e_r_n.

BBUUGGSS
       On  BSD systems, the -_s option reports sizes that are half
       the correct values for files that are NFS-mounted from HP-
       UX  systems.   On HP-UX systems, it reports sizes that are
       twice the correct values for files  that  are  NFS-mounted
       from BSD systems.  This is due to a flaw in HP-UX; it also
       affects the HP-UX llss program.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
