       This  manual page documents the GNU version of llnn.  If the
       last argument names an existing directory, llnn  links  each
       other  given  file  into a file with the same name in that
       directory.  If only one file is given, it links that  file
       into  the current directory.  Otherwise, if only two files
       are given, it links the first onto the second.  It  is  an
       error  if  the  last  argument is not a directory and more
       than two files are given.  It makes hard links by default.
       By default, it does not remove existing files.

       -_b, --_b_a_c_k_u_p
              Make backups of files that are about to be removed.

       -_d, -_F, --_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Allow the super-user to make hard links to directo-
              ries.

       -_f, --_f_o_r_c_e
              Remove existing destination files.

       -_i, --_i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e
              Prompt   whether  to  remove  existing  destination
              files.

       -_s, --_s_y_m_b_o_l_i_c
              Make symbolic links instead of hard links.

              The suffix used for making simple backup files  can

              variable, which can be overridden by  this  option.
              If  neither  of those is given, the default is `~',
              as it is in Emacs.

              overridden by this option.  If  VVEERRSSIIOONN__CCOONNTTRROOLL  is
              not  set  and this option is not given, the default
              backup type is `existing'.  The value of  the  VVEERR--
              SSIIOONN__CCOONNTTRROOLL  environment variable and the argument
              to this option are like  the  GNU  Emacs  `version-
              control'  variable;  they  also  recognize synonyms
              that are more descriptive.  The  valid  values  are
              (unique abbreviations are accepted):

              `t' or `numbered'
                     Always make numbered backups.

              `nil' or `existing'
                     Make  numbered backups of files that already
                     have them, simple backups of the others.

              `never' or `simple'
                     Always make simple backups.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
