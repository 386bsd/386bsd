       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU  version of rrmmddiirr.
       rrmmddiirr removes each given empty  directory.   If  any  non-
       option argument does not refer to an existing empty direc-
       tory, it is an error.

       -_p, --_p_a_t_h
              Remove any parent directories that  are  explicitly
              mentioned  in  an  argument,  if  they become empty
              after the argument file is removed.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
