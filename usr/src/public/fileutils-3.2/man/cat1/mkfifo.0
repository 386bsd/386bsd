       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU version of mmkkffiiffoo.
       mmkkffiiffoo creates a FIFO with each given name.   By  default,
       the  mode  of  created FIFOs is 0666 minus the bits set in
       the umask.

       -_m, --_m_o_d_e _m_o_d_e
              Set the mode of created FIFOs  to  _m_o_d_e,  which  is
              symbolic  as  in chmod and uses the default mode as
              the point of departure.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
