       This manual page documents the GNU version of ddff.  ddff dis-
       plays the amount of disk space available on the filesystem
       containing each argument pathname.  If  no  pathnames  are
       given,  the  space  available  on  all  currently  mounted
       filesystems is shown.  Disk space is shown in 1K blocks by
       default,  unless  the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT
       is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.

       If an argument is the full pathname of a disk device  node
       containing a mounted filesystem, ddff shows the space avail-
       able on that filesystem rather than on the filesystem con-
       taining  the  device node (which is almost always the root
       filesystem).  This version of ddff can not  show  the  space
       available  on unmounted filesystems, because on most kinds
       of systems doing so  requires  very  nonportable  intimate
       knowledge of filesystem structures.

       -_a, --_a_l_l
              Include  in  the  listing  filesystems  that have 0
              blocks,  which  are  omitted  by   default.    Such
              filesystems  are  typically special-purpose pseudo-
              filesystems, such as automounter entries.  On  some
              systems, filesystems of type ``ignore'' or ``auto''
              are also omitted by default  and  included  in  the
              listing by this option.

       -_i, --_i_n_o_d_e_s
              List  inode  usage  information  instead  of  block
              usage.  An inode is a special kind  of  disk  block
              that contains information about a file, such as its
              owner, permissions, timestamps, and location on the
              disk.

       -_k, --_k_i_l_o_b_y_t_e_s
              Print  sizes  in  1K  blocks  instead  of  512-byte
              blocks.  This overrides  the  environment  variable
              POSIXLY_CORRECT.

       -_P, --_p_o_r_t_a_b_i_l_i_t_y
              Use  the  POSIX  output  format.   This is like the
              default format except that  the  information  about
              each  filesystem  is  always printed on exactly one
              line; a mount device is never  put  on  a  line  by
              itself.   This  means that if the mount device name
              is more  than  20  characters  long  (as  for  some

       -_t, --_t_y_p_e _f_s_t_y_p_e
              Limit  the  listing  to filesystems of type _f_s_t_y_p_e.
              Multiple filesystem types can be  shown  by  giving
              multiple  -_t  options.   By default, all filesystem
              types are listed.

       -_v     Ignored; for compatibility with System  V  versions
              of ddff.

       The  long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well
       as `--', for compatibility with previous releases.   Even-
       tually  support  for  `+'  will  be removed, because it is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
