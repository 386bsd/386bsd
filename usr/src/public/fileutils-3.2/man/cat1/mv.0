       This manual page documents the GNU version of mmvv.  If  the
       last  argument  names an existing directory, mmvv moves each
       other given file into a file with the same  name  in  that
       directory.   Otherwise,  if  only  two files are given, it
       moves the first onto the second.  It is an  error  if  the
       last  argument  is not a directory and more than two files
       are given.  It can move only regular files across filesys-
       tems.

       If a destination file is unwritable, the standard input is
       a tty, and the -_f or  --_f_o_r_c_e  option  is  not  given,  mmvv
       prompts  the  user  for whether to overwrite the file.  If
       the response does not begin with `y' or `Y', the  file  is
       skipped.

       -_b, --_b_a_c_k_u_p
              Make backups of files that are about to be removed.

       -_f, --_f_o_r_c_e
              Remove existing destination files and never  prompt
              the user.

       -_i, --_i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e
              Prompt  whether  to overwrite each destination file
              that already exists.   If  the  response  does  not
              begin with `y' or `Y', the file is skipped.

       -_u, --_u_p_d_a_t_e
              Do  not  move  a  nondirectory that has an existing
              destination with the  same  or  newer  modification
              time.

       -_v, --_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
              Print the name of each file before moving it.

              The  suffix used for making simple backup files can
              be set with  the  SSIIMMPPLLEE__BBAACCKKUUPP__SSUUFFFFIIXX  environment
              variable,  which  can be overridden by this option.
              If neither of those is given, the default  is  `~',

              The  type  of backups made can be set with the VVEERR--
              SSIIOONN__CCOONNTTRROOLL environment  variable,  which  can  be
              overridden  by  this option.  If VVEERRSSIIOONN__CCOONNTTRROOLL is
              not set and this option is not given,  the  default
              backup  type  is `existing'.  The value of the VVEERR--
              SSIIOONN__CCOONNTTRROOLL environment variable and the  argument
              to  this  option  are  like the GNU Emacs `version-
              control' variable;  they  also  recognize  synonyms
              that  are  more  descriptive.  The valid values are
              (unique abbreviations are accepted):

              `t' or `numbered'
                     Always make numbered backups.

              `nil' or `existing'
                     Make numbered backups of files that  already
                     have them, simple backups of the others.

              `never' or `simple'
                     Always make simple backups.

       The  long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well
       as `--', for compatibility with previous releases.   Even-
       tually  support  for  `+'  will  be removed, because it is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
