	* Version 3.2.

Tue Mar 31 13:39:06 1992  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* df.c (main): stat all arg pathnames before getting
	list of mounted filesystems.
	(show_entry, show_point): Take a struct stat * as another arg,
	to avoid repeatedly statting files.

	of loop.

	(get_fs_usge): Call it.

	* dd.c (copy_simple, copy_with_block, copy_with_unblock,
	translate_buffer, swab_buffer): New functions, mostly made

	pad the final block with spaces.
 
Wed Mar 25 14:35:17 1992  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* system.h: Don't use BSIZE for calculating ST_BLKSIZE if it
	isn't defined.

	* mountlist.c [MOUNTED_FREAD], fsusage.c [STAT_READ]: New code
	for SVR2, from archive@ideahb.sublink.org (Lele Gaifax).

	* df.c (main): Pass the new arg.

	* fsinfo.h: Add function decls.

	* chown.c, chgrp.c, chmod.c: Remove -L option.  Didn't handle
	changing symlinks correctly and wasn't very useful.

	defined in sys/types.h.  That's probably right for old Unixes
	and avoids trying to find the C preprocessor.

	* df.c: Don't declare sync, to avoid conflict with Minix (and
	maybe others) unistd.h.
	(show_point): Cast -1 to dev_t before comparing, in case dev_t

Thu Sep  5 23:40:39 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at apple-gunkies)

	* system.h: Instead of defining getwd in terms of getcwd with
	PATH_MAX as an arg (which might be -1 on POSIX), define getcwd
	in terms of getwd.
	* du.c (main): Call getcwd with path_max as an arg.

	* install.c (change_attributes): Do chown before chmod, so
	chown doesn't remove set[ug]id bits.

	* Version 3.1.

	* df.c, fsinfo.c, fsinfo.h: New program.

	filesystems. 

Thu Aug 22 10:53:23 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at apple-gunkies)

	* src/Makefile.in: Workaround #10006 for C compilers that are
	too dumb to allow -c and -o together.  Copy the source files.
	* system.h: Moved from src to lib to avoid having to add yet
	more -I options to CFLAGS.

	* du.c, ls.c: If POSIX_ME_HARDER is set in environment, use
	512-byte blocks by default.

Wed Aug 21 13:03:14 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.0.

	* system.h, backupfile.c, savedir.c [VOID_CLOSEDIR]: Fake a
	return value for closedir, which returns void on some systems,
	like Sequents.

Tue Aug 20 22:22:47 1991  Jim Meyering (meyering at nutrimat)

	* mvdir.c (main):  Clean up loop to stat component
	directories -- as in makepath and pathchk.

	don't choke on it.

	* backupfile.c (max_backup_version): Check closedir return
	value (though it might not do any good).

Tue Aug  6 20:50:56 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wheat-chex)

	* configure, Makefile.in's: Support +srcdir option, using VPATH.
	Don't check for bison, just try it and if it fails use yacc.
	Create config.status.  Fix up clean targets.

	Most of the following is from Paul Eggert:
	* savedir.c (savedir), ls.c (print_dir), rm.c
	(clear_directory): Check closedir return for errors.
	* dd.c (main): Check for stdin or stdout being closed.
	* dd.c (quit), install.c (copy_file): Check for close errors.

	* configure: Only compile fileblocks.c if st_blocks is missing.

	* cp.c (copy): Make directories with initial mode of source
	permissions minus umask, plus 0700.  For POSIX and John Gilmore.

	* eaccess.c: Support POSIX method of getting multiple groups.

	* xmalloc.c (xmalloc, xrealloc): Exit with value 2 on error,
	not 1, so cmp can use it.

Sat Jul 20 14:24:40 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at bleen)

	* Move cat cmp cut expand head paste split tac tail unexpand
	to textutils.

	* system.h [MKFIFO_MISSING]: Define mkfifo macro.
	* cp.c, mkfifo.c: Don't define it.

	* configure: Also look in sys/signal.h for signal decl.

Sun Jul 14 22:43:57 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Rename touchtm.y back to posixtm.y, as the date command will
	use it too.

Mon Jul  8 22:56:36 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Replace lib/Makefile with lib/Makefile.in.
	* configure: For some library functions that might be missing,
	conditionally add the .o files to lib/Makefile instead of

	Add notice to top of generated Makefile saying that it's
	automatically generated.

Thu Jun 13 00:50:18 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 2.1.

	* configure: If rename is missing, define MVDIR.
	Use , instead of / as sed substitution separator so variables'
	values can contain slashes.

	* du.c (main): Use alloca to allocate `wd' instead of making

	makefile from makefile.skel, to more closely follow the new
	GNU coding standards.

	* ls.c (file_interesting): Use POSIX.2 fnmatch instead of glob_match.

	* configure: If $RANDOM is implemented (ksh, bash or zsh), use
	the `type' builtin to determine if gcc, bison, ranlib are
	available.  ksh writes "fubar: command not found" to stderr,
	foiling the test -n "`command 2>&1`" method.
	Remove makefile on signal.

	* system.h: Include sys/param.h if not _POSIX_SOURCE instead
	of if not POSIX, to get DEV_BSIZE.

	* makepath.c, posixtime.y, system.h: Add _AIX case to alloca decl.

	* fileblocks.c (st_blocks), system.h (ST_NBLOCKS): Always
	return number of 512 byte blocks, not DEV_BSIZE blocks.
	(convert_blocks): Always expect 512-byte blocks.

Thu Jun  6 12:54:26 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure: New shell script to aid compilation.

Mon Jun  3 16:42:41 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wheat-chex)

	* cp.h: Remove some decls of functions returning int that
	conflict with prototypes on HPUX.

	* cp.c (make_path, re_protect): New functions from Jim
	Meyering.  Changes to other functions as well, to add +path,
	+link, +symbolic-link options.

Sun Jun  2 15:45:24 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wheat-chex)

Thu May 16 23:12:01 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at albert.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* cp.c, mv.c, ln.c: Use alloca and strcpy directly instead of
	in a macro for generating backup filename.  The latter
	sometimes coredumps for some reason.

Sat Apr 20 00:03:09 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* dd.c: Add conv=notrunc and truncate output file by default,
	for POSIX.

	* rm.c (rm): Refuse to remove path/. and path/.., as well as `.'
	and `..', for POSIX.

	* chown.c: Allow `:' as well as `.' to separate group from
	user, for POSIX.2 draft 11.

	* Many programs: Don't bother to get the long-option index
	value from getopt_long, since we ignore it.

	* Many programs: Separate long-option option names from their
	args with `=' instead of ` ' in usage messages.

	* touch.c (touch): Don't refuse to touch non-regular files.

Wed Apr 10 12:19:30 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	remember synonym for -dpR.

Fri Mar 15 16:16:54 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at geech.ai.mit.edu)

	* mv.c (copy): Try to preserve file ownership in
	cross-filesystem copies.

	* strdup.c: Only compile if STRDUP_MISSING.
	If STDC_HEADERS, use ANSI include files.

	* backupfile.c, rm.c: Go back to using d_ino instead of
	d_fileno.  POSIX.1 specifies neither, and d_ino is more
	common, perhaps ubiquitous.

	* chown.c (describe_change): Don't print the group name if it
	didn't change (thus is a null pointer).
	(main): Initialize group name to null.

	* install.c (change_attributes): Don't ignore EPERM for chown,

	* Version 1.4.

	* cp.h: Declare free returning void, not int, so it

	(swab_array): New function.

	* dd.c (copy): If sync and noerror, zero the buffer before the
	read instead of after so that any data read before an error

	other than 512 or 1024 bytes.

	* du.c (main): Exit with status 0 normally.

	* ln.c (do_link): Take out code to give an error if source and
	dest are the same file.  The dubious usefulness of the special
	case to prevent 'ln x x' from removing 'x' (ln -i can be used

	0 (as on pipe reads on some systems), use BSIZE instead.

	control whether st_blksize and st_blocks are used.
	* Makefile, system.h, backupfile.c: Use DIRENT to control

	(usage): Document it.

	* mv.c (movefile): Remove trailing slashes from FROM (some
	filename completion systems add them for dirs, and they cause
	the rename syscall to fail).

	* cp.c (copy_reg): Change error handling after lseek, since
	  this is a fatal error.  Also change error message to
	  something more generally understood.
	* Handle files that end in a zero block on USG systems.

	* cp-aux.c (error): Use FATAL to recog fatal errs.

	* ln.c: Remove incorrect comment.

	* cp.c, cp-aux.c (usage): Change +dereference option to
	+no-dereference, since dereferencing is done by default and
	the option turns it off.
