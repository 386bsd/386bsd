This directory contains perl-4.019 compiled for 386bsd.

To install it, put this directory containing bin and lib
in /usr/src/contrib/perl-4.019.  Then link the executables
and man pages into /usr/contrib:

cd /usr/contrib/bin
ln -s /usr/src/contrib/perl-4.019/bin/* .
cd /usr/contrib/man/cat1
ln -s /usr/src/contrib/perl-4.019/man/cat1/* .

The path to the libraries is compiled in, so the only firm reqirement
for installation is that /usr/src/contrib/perl-4.019/lib must contain
the perl library files.

Taintperl is not included due to problems with cc running out of
virtual memory.  Perl failed the following tests:

io/dup.........FAILED on test 0
io/pipe........FAILED on test 5
op/dbm.........FAILED on test 2
lib/big........FAILED on test 73

----------------------------------------------------------------
Notes on what was done to build perl 4.019 on 386bsd:

I did not do a 'make realclean' so the Makefile, config.h and
parser are already present in the source directory, perl-4.019.
Here are the steps taken to generate them and the executables
in the bin directory.

Bash works with Configure while ash did not.  Ash has not handled
other GNU configure scripts, so use 'bash Configure' to set up the
Makefile, etc.

Make would not generate the parser.  Type 'make -n' to find out
what it needs to do (yacc, etc.) and type it in by hand.

THe supplied setenv function in util.c takes fewer arguments than
the systems version in libc.a.  I #ifdefed out the one in perl's
util.c and added the needed third argument to the calls in eval.c
and stub.c

Taintperl would not compile because cc exausted virtual memory
compiling teval.c.  Surprisingly, adding another 30Mb swap partition
did not help.  So, taintperl is not included.  If you don't plan
on running suid perl scripts, you probably won't miss it.

Perl's realloc failed, so I recompiled with out it and used the
malloc/realloc in libc.a insead.

Nroff ran out of memory formatting the perl manual page, so cat1/perl.0
is incomplete.  The GNU texinfo formated documentation should be complete
though.
