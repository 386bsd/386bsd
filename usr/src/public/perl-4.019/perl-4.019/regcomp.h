/*
 * The "internal use only" fields in regexp.h are present to pass info from
 * compile to execute that permits the execute phase to run lots faster on
 * simple cases.  They are:
 *
 * regstart	str that must begin a match; Nullch if none obvious
 * reganch	is the match anchored (at beginning-of-line only)?
 * regmust	string (pointer into program) that match must include, or NULL
 *  [regmust changed to STR* for bminstr()--law]
 * regmlen	length of regmust string
 *  [regmlen not used currently]
 *
 * Regstart and reganch permit very fast decisions on suitable starting points
 * for a match, cutting down the work a lot.  Regmust permits fast rejection
 * of lines that cannot possibly match.  The regmust tests are costly enough
 * that regcomp() supplies a regmust only if the r.e. contains something
 * potentially expensive (at present, the only such thing detected is * or +
 * at the start of the r.e., which can involve a lot of backup).  Regmlen is
 * supplied because the test in regexec() needs it and regcomp() is computing
 * it anyway.
 * [regmust is now supplied always.  The tests that use regmust have a
 * heuristic that disables the test if it usually matches.]
 *
 * [In fact, we now use regmust in many cases to locate where the search
 * starts in the string, so if regback is >= 0, the regmust search is never
 * wasted effort.  The regback variable says how many characters back from
 * where regmust matched is the earliest possible start of the match.
 * For instance, /[a-z].foo/ has a regmust of 'foo' and a regback of 2.]

/*
 * Structure for regexp "program".  This is essentially a linear encoding
 * of a nondeterministic finite-state machine (aka syntax charts or
 * "railroad normal form" in parsing technology).  Each node is an opcode
 * plus a "next" pointer, possibly plus an operand.  "Next" pointers of
 * all nodes except BRANCH implement concatenation; a "next" pointer with
 * a BRANCH on both ends of it is connecting two alternatives.  (Here we
 * have one of the subtle syntax dependencies:  an individual BRANCH (as
 * opposed to a collection of them) is never concatenated with anything
 * because of operator precedence.)  The operand of some types of node is
 * a literal string; for others, it is a node leading into a sub-FSM.  In
 * particular, the operand of a BRANCH node is the first node of the branch.
 * (NB this is *not* a tree structure:  the tail of the branch connects
 * to the thing following the set of BRANCHes.)  The opcodes are:

/*
 * Opcode notes:
 *
 * BRANCH	The set of branches constituting a single choice are hooked
 *		together with their "next" pointers, since precedence prevents
 *		anything being concatenated to any individual branch.  The
 *		"next" pointer of the last BRANCH in a choice points to the
 *		thing following the whole choice.  This is also where the
 *		final "next" pointer of each individual branch points; each
 *		branch starts with the operand node of a BRANCH node.
 *
 * BACK		Normal "next" pointers all implicitly point forward; BACK
 *		exists to make loop structures possible.
 *
 * STAR,PLUS	'?', and complex '*' and '+', are implemented as circular
 *		BRANCH structures using BACK.  Simple cases (one character
 *		per match) are implemented with STAR and PLUS for speed
 *		and to minimize recursive plunges.
 *
 * OPEN,CLOSE	...are numbered at compile time.

/*
 * A node is one char of opcode followed by two chars of "next" pointer.
 * "Next" pointers are stored as two 8-bit pieces, high order first.  The
 * value is a positive offset from the opcode of the node containing it.
 * An operand, if any, simply follows the node.  (Note that much of the
 * code generation knows about this implicit relationship.)
 *
 * Using two bytes for the "next" pointer is vast overkill for most things,
 * but allows patterns to get big without disasters.
 *
 * [If REGALIGN is defined, the "next" pointer is always aligned on an even
 * boundary, and reads the offset directly as a short.  Also, there is no
 * special test to reverse the sign of BACK pointers since the offset is
 * stored negative.]
