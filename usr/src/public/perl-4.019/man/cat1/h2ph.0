       _h_2_p_h  converts  any C header files specified to the corre-
       sponding Perl header file format.  It is most  easily  run
       while in /usr/include:

            cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/*

       If  run with no arguments, filters standard input to stan-
       dard output.

       Doesn't construct the %sizeof array for you.

       It doesn't handle all C constructs, but it does attempt to
       isolate definitions inside evals so that you  can  get  at
       the definitions that it can translate.

       It's  only  intended  as  a  rough  tool.  You may need to
       dicker with the files produced.
