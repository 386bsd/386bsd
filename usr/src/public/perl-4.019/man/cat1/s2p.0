       _S_2_p  takes  a sed script specified on the command line (or
       from standard input) and produces a comparable _p_e_r_l script
       on the standard output.

       --nn   specifies  that  this  sed  script was always invoked
            with  a  sed  -n.   Otherwise  a  switch  parser   is
            prepended to the front of the script.

       --pp   specifies that this sed script was never invoked with
            a sed -n.  Otherwise a switch parser is prepended  to
            the front of the script.

       The perl script produced looks very sed-ish, and there may
       very well be better ways to express what you want to do in
       perl.   For  instance,  s2p  does  not make any use of the
       split operator, but you might want to.

       The perl script you end up with may be  either  faster  or
       slower  than  the  original  sed  script.   If you're only
       interested in speed you'll just have to try it both  ways.
       Of course, if you want to do something sed doesn't do, you
       have no choice.  It's often possible to speed up the  perl
       script by various methods, such as deleting all references
       to $\ and chop.
