/* Make directory DPATH, with permission mode DMODE.

   Written by Robert Rother, Mariah Corporation, August 1985
   (sdcsvax!rmr or rmr@uscd).  If you want it, it's yours.

   Severely hacked over by John Gilmore to make a 4.2BSD compatible
   subroutine.	11Mar86; hoptoad!gnu

   Modified by rmtodd@uokmax 6-28-87 -- when making an already existing dir,
   subroutine didn't return EEXIST.  It does now. */
