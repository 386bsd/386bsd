GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
**************************

                            Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. 
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can
apply it to your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do
these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this
free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and
passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not
the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on the original authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear
that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
     a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
     distributed under the terms of this General Public License. 
     The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
     "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
     derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
     containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
     with modifications and/or translated into another language. 
     (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
     term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
     are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. 
     The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
     output from the Program is covered only if its contents
     constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
     been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true
     depends on what the Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
     intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
     absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
     Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
     copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
     exchange for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of
     Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       1. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
          notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
          any change.

       2. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
          that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
          Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at
          no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
          License.

       3. If the modified program normally reads commands
          interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
          running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
          to print or display an announcement including an
          appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
          warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
          that users may redistribute the program under these
          conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
          License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
          but does not normally print such an announcement, your
          work based on the Program is not required to print an
          announcement.)

             These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
     separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
     do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
     separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as
     part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
     distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
     whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
     whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
     it.

        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
     or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
     the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution
     of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
     the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the
     Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does
     not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
     terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one
     of the following:

       1. Accompany it with the complete corresponding
          machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
          under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
          customarily used for software interchange; or,

       2. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
          your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
          complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
          code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and
          2 above on a medium customarily used for software
          interchange; or,

       3. Accompany it with the information you received as to the
          offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This
          alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution
          and only if you received the program in object code or
          executable form with such an offer, in accord with
          Subsection b above.)

             The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
     work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work,
     complete source code means all the source code for all modules
     it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
     plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
     of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source
     code distributed need not include anything that is normally
     distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
     components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
     system on which the executable runs, unless that component
     itself accompanies the executable.

        If distribution of executable or object code is made by
     offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
     equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
     counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
     parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
     object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
     is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
     this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
     rights, from you under this License will not have their
     licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
     compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to
     modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. 
     These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
     License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program
     (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
     conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
     or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
     the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing
     compliance by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
     simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
     other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
     distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
     license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
     Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
     through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
     this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of
     the Program.

        If any portion of this section is held invalid or
     unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of
     the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is
     intended to apply in other circumstances.

        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
     infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
     contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole
     purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
     distribution system, which is implemented by public license
     practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the
     wide range of software distributed through that system in
     reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
     the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
     distribute software through any other system and a licensee
     cannot impose that choice.

        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
     believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
     interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
     Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
     distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
     distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
     excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the
     limitation as if written in the body of this License.

 10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

        Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If
     the Program specifies a version number of this License which
     applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
     following the terms and conditions either of that version or of
     any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
     If the Program does not specify a version number of this
     License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
     Software Foundation.

 11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
     the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
     copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
     Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the
     free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
     promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                     NO WARRANTY

 12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE
     ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS
     WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
     COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
     OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
     YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
     WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
     HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=======================================================

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is
to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change
under these terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
paper mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and
`show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the
program, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
     
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking
proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want
to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this
License.

Installation
************

   This section describes the installation of pcl-cvs, the GNU Emacs
CVS front-end.  You should install not only the elisp files
themselves, but also the on-line documentation so that your users
will know how to use it.  You can create typeset documentation from
the file `pcl-cvs.texinfo' as well as an on-line info file.  The
following steps are also described in the file `INSTALL' in the
source directory.

* Menu:

* Pcl-cvs installation::         How to install pcl-cvs on your system.
* On-line manual installation::  How to install the on-line manual.
* Typeset manual installation::  How to create typeset documentation

File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Pcl-cvs installation,  Next: On-line manual installation,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Installation

Installation of the pcl-cvs program
===================================

  1. Edit the file `Makefile' to reflect the situation at your site. 
     The only things you have to change is the definition of
     `lispdir' and `infodir'.  The elisp files will be copied to
     `lispdir', and the info file to `infodir'.

  2. Configure pcl-cvs.el

        There are a couple of paths that you have to check to make
     sure that they match you system.  They appear early in the file
     pcl-cvs.el.

        *NOTE:*  If your system is running emacs 18.57 or earlier
     you MUST uncomment the line that says:

          (setq delete-exited-processes nil)

             Setting `delete-exited-processes' to `nil' works around a bug
     in emacs that causes it to dump core.  The bug was fixed in
     emacs 18.58.

  3. Type `make install' in the source directory.  This will
     byte-compile all `.el' files and copy both the `.el' and the
     `.elc' into the directory you specified in step 1.

        If you don't want to install the `.el' files but only the
     `.elc' files (the byte-compiled files), you can type ``make
     install_elc'' instead of ``make install''.

        If you only want to create the compiled elisp files, but
     don't want to install them, you can type `make elcfiles'
     instead.  This is what happens if you only type `make' without
     parameters.

  4. Edit the file `default.el' in your emacs lisp directory (usually
     `/usr/gnu/emacs/lisp' or something similar) and enter the
     contents of the file `pcl-cvs-startup.el' into it.  It contains
     a couple of `auto-load's that facilitates the use of pcl-cvs.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: On-line manual installation,  Next: Typeset manual installation,  Prev: Pcl-cvs installation,  Up: Installation

Installation of the on-line manual.
===================================

  1. Create the info file `pcl-cvs' from `pcl-cvs.texinfo' by typing
     `make info'.  If you don't have the program `makeinfo' you can
     get it by anonymous ftp from e.g. `ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu' as
     `pub/gnu/texinfo-2.14.tar.Z' (there might be a newer version
     there when you read this), or you could use the preformatted
     info file `pcl-cvs.info' that is included in the distribution
     (type `cp pcl-cvs.info pcl-cvs').

  2. Move the info file `pcl-cvs' to your standard info directory. 
     This might be called something like `/usr/gnu/emacs/info'.

  3. Edit the file `dir' in the info directory and enter one line to
     contain a pointer to the info file `pcl-cvs'.  The line can, for
     instance, look like this:

          * Pcl-cvs: (pcl-cvs).       An Emacs front-end to CVS.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Typeset manual installation,  Prev: On-line manual installation,  Up: Installation

How to make typeset documentation from pcl-cvs.texinfo
======================================================

   If you have TeX installed at your site, you can make a typeset
manual from `pcl-cvs.texinfo'.

  1. Run TeX by typing ``make pcl-cvs.dvi''.  You will not get the
     indices unless you have the `texindex' program.

  2. Convert the resulting device independent file `pcl-cvs.dvi' to a
     form which your printer can output and print it.  If you have a
     postscript printer there is a program, `dvi2ps', which does. 
     There is also a program which comes together with TeX, `dvips',
     which you can use.

Contributors to pcl-cvs
=======================

   Contributions to the package are welcome.  I have limited time to
work on this project, but I will gladly add any code that you
contribute to me to this package (*note Reporting bugs and ideas::.).

   The following persons have made contributions to pcl-cvs.

   * Brian Berliner wrote CVS, together with some other contributors. 
     Without his work on CVS this package would be useless...

   * Per Cederqvist wrote most of the otherwise unattributed
     functions in pcl-cvs as well as all documentation.

   * Inge Wallin (`inge@lysator.liu.se') wrote the skeleton to
     `pcl-cvs.texinfo', and gave useful comments on it.  He also
     wrote the files `elib-node.el' and `compile-all.el'.  The file
     `cookie.el' was inspired by Inge.

   * Linus Tolke (`linus@lysator.liu.se') contributed useful comments
     on both the functionality and the documentation.

Where can I get pcl-cvs?
========================

   This release of pcl-cvs is included in the CVS 1.3 distribution. 
However, since pcl-cvs has had less time to mature (the first line of
code was written less than a year ago) it is likely that there will
be a new release of pcl-cvs before the next release of CVS.

   The latest release of pcl-cvs can be fetched via anonymous ftp
from `ftp.lysator.liu.se', (IP no. 130.236.254.1) in the directory
`pub/emacs'.  If you don't live in Scandinavia you should probably
check with archie to see if there is a site closer to you that
archives pcl-cvs.

   New releases will be announced to appropriate newsgroups.  If you
send your email address to me I will add you to my list of people to
mail when I make a new release.

Getting started
***************

   This document assumes that you know what CVS is, and that you at
least knows the fundamental concepts of CVS.  If that is not the
case you should read the man page for CVS.

   Pcl-cvs is only useful once you have checked out a module.  So
before you invoke it you must have a copy of a module somewhere in
the file system.

   You invoke pcl-cvs by typing `M-x pcl-cvs RET'.  If your emacs
responds with `[No match]' your system administrator has not
installed pcl-cvs properly.  Try `M-x load-library RET pcl-cvs RET'. 
If that also fails - talk to your root.  If it succeeds you might put
this line in your `.emacs' file so that you don't have to type the
`load-library' command every time you wish to use pcl-cvs:

     (autoload 'cvs-update "pcl-cvs" nil t)

   The function `cvs-update' will ask for a directory.  The command
`cvs update' will be run in that directory.  (It should contain
files that have been checked out from a CVS archive.)  The output
from `cvs' will be parsed and presented in a table in a buffer called
`*cvs*'.  It might look something like this:

     PCL-CVS release 1.02.
     
     In directory /users/ceder/FOO/test:
       Updated     bar
       Updated     file.txt
       Modified ci namechange
       Updated     newer
     
     In directory /users/ceder/FOO/test/sub:
       Modified ci ChangeLog
     ---------- End -----

   In this example the three files (`bar', `file.txt' and `newer')
that are marked with `Updated' have been copied from the CVS
repository to `/users/ceder/FOO/test/' since someone else have
checked in newer versions of them.  Two files (`namechange' and
`sub/ChangeLog') have been modified locally, and needs to be checked
in.

   You can move the cursor up and down in the buffer with `C-n' and
`C-p' or `n' and `p'.  If you press `c' on one of the `Modified'
files that file will be checked in to the CVS repository. *Note
Committing changes::.  You can press `x' to get rid of the
"uninteresting" files that have only been `Updated' (and don't
require any further action from you).

   You can also easily get a `diff' between your modified file and
the base version that you started from, and you can get the output
from `cvs log' and `cvs status' on the listed files simply by
pressing a key (*note Getting info about files::.).

Buffer contents
***************

   The display contains four columns.  They contain, from left to
right:

   * An asterisk when the file is "marked" (*note Selected files::.).

   * The status of the file.  See *Note File status::, for more
     information.

   * A "need to be checked in"-marker (`ci').

   * The file name.

File: pcl-cvs,  Node: File status,  Next: Selected files,  Prev: Buffer contents,  Up: Buffer contents

File status
===========

   The `file status' field can have the following values:

`Updated'
     The file was brought up to date with respect to the repository.
      This is done for any file that exists in the repository but
     not in your source, and for files that you haven't changed but
     are not the most recent versions available in the repository.

`Modified'
     The file is modified in  your  working  directory, and there
     was no modification to the same file in the repository.

`Merged'
     The file is modified in your working directory, and there were
     modifications in the repository as well as in your copy, but
     they were merged successfully, without conflict, in your
     working directory.

`Conflict'
     A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes to
     FILE with changes from the source repository.  FILE (the copy
     in your working directory) is now the output of the `rcsmerge'
     command on the two versions; an unmodified copy of your file is
     also in your working directory, with the name `.#FILE.VERSION',
     where VERSION is the RCS revision that your modified file
     started from.  *Note Viewing differences::, for more details.

`Added'
     The file has been added by you, but it still needs to be
     checked in to the repository.

`Removed'
     The file has been removed by you, but it needs to be checked in
     to the repository.  You can resurrect it by typing `a' (*note
     Adding and removing files::.).

`Unknown'
     A file that was detected in your directory, but that neither
     appears in the repository, nor is present on the list of files
     that CVS should ignore.

   There are also a few special cases, that rarely occur, which have
longer strings in the fields:

`Removed from repository'
     The file has been removed from your directory since someone has
     removed it from the repository.  (It is still present in the
     Attic directory, so no permanent loss has occurred).  This,
     unlike the other entries in this table, is not an error
     condition.

`Removed from repository, changed by you'
     You have modified a file that someone have removed from the
     repository.  You can correct this situation by removing the
     file manually (see *note Adding and removing files::.).

`Removed by you, changed in repository'
     You have removed a file, and before you committed the removal
     someone committed a change to that file.  You could use `a' to
     resurrect the file (see *note Adding and removing files::.).

`Move away FILE - it is in the way'
     For some reason CVS does not like the file FILE.  Rename or
     remove it.

`This repository is missing! Remove this dir manually.'
     It is impossible to remove a directory in the CVS repository in
     a clean way.  Someone have tried to remove one, and CVS gets
     confused.  Remove your copy of the directory.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Selected files,  Prev: File status,  Up: Buffer contents

Selected files
==============

   Many of the commands works on the current set of "selected" files.

   * If there are any files that are marked they constitute the set
     of selected files.

   * Otherwise, if the cursor points to a file, that file is the
     selected file.

   * Otherwise, if the cursor points to a directory, all the files
     in that directory that appears in the buffer are the selected
     files.

   This scheme might seem a little complicated, but once one get
used to it, it is quite powerful.

   *Note Marking files:: tells how you mark and unmark files.

File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Updating the directory,  Next: Movement commands,  Prev: Commands,  Up: Commands

Updating the directory
======================

`M-x cvs-update'
     Run a `cvs update' command.  You will be asked for the
     directory in which the `cvs update' will be run.  The output
     will be parsed by pcl-cvs, and the result printed in the
     `*cvs*' buffer (see *note Buffer contents::. for a description
     of the contents).

     By default, `cvs-update' will descend recursively into
     subdirectories.  You can avoid that behavior by giving a prefix
     argument to it (e.g., by typing `C-u M-x cvs-update RET').

     All other commands in pcl-cvs requires that you have a `*cvs*'
     buffer.  This is the command that you use to get one.

`g'
     This will run `cvs update' again.  It will always use the same
     buffer that was used with the previous `cvs update'.  Give a
     prefix argument to avoid descending into subdirectories.  This
     runs the command `cvs-update-no-prompt'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Movement commands,  Next: Marking files,  Prev: Updating the directory,  Up: Commands

Movement Commands
=================

   You can use most normal Emacs commands to move forward and
backward in the buffer.  Some keys are rebound to functions that
take advantage of the fact that the buffer is a pcl-cvs buffer:

`SPC'
`C-n'
`n'
     These keys move the cursor one file forward, towards the end of
     the buffer (`cookie-next-cookie').

`C-p'
`p'
     These keys move one file backward, towards the beginning of the
     buffer (`cookie-previous-cookie').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Marking files,  Next: Committing changes,  Prev: Movement commands,  Up: Commands

Marking files
=============

   Pcl-cvs works on a set of "selected files" (*note Selected
files::.).  You can mark and unmark files with these commands:

`m'
     This marks the file that the cursor is positioned on.  If the
     cursor is positioned on a directory all files in that directory
     will be marked.  (`cvs-mark').

`u'
     Unmark the file that the cursor is positioned on. If the cursor
     is on a directory, all files in that directory will be unmarked. 
     (`cvs-unmark').

`M'
     Mark *all* files in the buffer (`cvs-mark-all-files').

`U'
     Unmark *all* files (`cvs-unmark-all-files').

`DEL'
     Unmark the file on the previous line, and move point to that
     line (`cvs-unmark-up').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Committing changes,  Next: Editing files,  Prev: Marking files,  Up: Commands

Committing changes
==================

`c'
     All files that have a "need to be checked in"-marker (*note
     Buffer contents::.) can be checked in with the `c' command.  It
     checks in all selected files (*note Selected files::.) (except
     those who lack the "ci"-marker - they are ignored).  Pressing
     `c' causes `cvs-commit' to be run.

     When you press `c' you will get a buffer called
     `*cvs-commit-message*'.  Enter the log message for the file(s)
     in it.  When you are ready you should press `C-c C-c' to
     actually commit the files (using `cvs-edit-done').

     Normally the `*cvs-commit-message*' buffer will retain the log
     message from the previous commit, but if the variable
     `cvs-erase-input-buffer' is set to a non-nil value the buffer
     will be erased.  Point and mark will always be located around
     the entire buffer so that you can easily erase it with `C-w'
     (`kill-region').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Editing files,  Next: Getting info about files,  Prev: Committing changes,  Up: Commands

Editing files
=============

   There are currently three commands that can be used to find a
file (that is, load it into a buffer and start editing it there). 
These commands work on the line that the cursor is situated at. 
They ignore any marked files.

`f'
     Find the file that the cursor points to.  Run `dired'

     (*note Dired: (Emacs)Dired.)

          if the cursor points to a directory (`cvs-find-file').

`o'
     Like `f', but use another window (`cvs-find-file-other-window').

`A'
     Invoke `add-change-log-entry-other-window' to edit a
     `ChangeLog' file.  The `ChangeLog' will be found in the
     directory of the file the cursor points to. 
     (`cvs-add-change-log-entry-other-window').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Getting info about files,  Next: Adding and removing files,  Prev: Editing files,  Up: Commands

Getting info about files
========================

   Both of the following commands can be customized.  *Note
Customization::.

`l'
     Run `cvs log' on all selected files, and show the result in a
     temporary buffer (`cvs-log').

`s'
     Run `cvs status' on all selected files, and show the result in a
     temporary buffer (`cvs-status').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Adding and removing files,  Next: Removing handled entries,  Prev: Getting info about files,  Up: Commands

Adding and removing files
=========================

   The following commands are available to make it easy to add and
remove files from the CVS repository.

`a'
     Add all selected files.  This command can be used on `Unknown'
     files (see *note File status::.).  The status of the file will
     change to `Added', and you will have to use `c' (`cvs-commit',
     see *note Committing changes::.) to really add the file to the
     repository.

     This command can also be used on `Removed' files (before you
     commit them) to resurrect them.

     Selected files that are neither `Unknown' nor `Removed' will be
     ignored by this command.

     The command that is run is `cvs-add'.

`r'
     This command removes the selected files (after prompting for
     confirmation).  The files are `rm'ed from your directory and
     (unless the status was `Unknown'; *note File status::.) they
     will also be `cvs remove'd.  If the files were `Unknown' they
     will disappear from the buffer.  Otherwise their status will
     change to `Removed', and you must use `c' (`cvs-commit', *note
     Committing changes::.) to commit the removal.

     The command that is run is `cvs-remove-file'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Removing handled entries,  Next: Ignoring files,  Prev: Adding and removing files,  Up: Commands

Removing handled entries
========================

`x'
     This command allows you to remove all entries that you have
     processed.  More specifically, the lines for `Updated' files
     (*note File status::. and files that have been checked in
     (*note Committing changes::.) are removed from the buffer.  If
     a directory becomes empty the heading for that directory is
     also removed.  This makes it easier to get an overview of what
     needs to be done.

     The command is called `cvs-remove-handled'.  If
     `cvs-auto-remove-handled' is set to non-`nil' this will
     automatically be performed after every commit.

`C-k'
     This command can be used for lines that `cvs-remove-handled'
     would not delete, but that you want to delete
     (`cvs-acknowledge').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Ignoring files,  Next: Viewing differences,  Prev: Removing handled entries,  Up: Commands

Ignoring files
==============

`i'
     Arrange so that CVS will ignore the selected files.  The file
     names are added to the `.cvsignore' file in the corresponding
     directory.  If the `.cvsignore' doesn't exist it will be
     created.

     The `.cvsignore' file should normally be added to the
     repository, but you could ignore it also if you like it better
     that way.

     This runs `cvs-ignore'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Viewing differences,  Prev: Ignoring files,  Up: Commands

Viewing differences
===================

`d'
     Display a `cvs diff' between the selected files and the RCS
     version that they are based on.  *Note Customization::
     describes how you can send flags to `cvs diff'.  (The function
     that does the job is `cvs-diff-cvs').

`b'
     If CVS finds a conflict while merging two versions of a file
     (during a `cvs update', *note Updating the directory::.) it
     will save the original file in a file called `.#FILE.VERSION'
     where FILE is the name of the file, and VERSION is the RCS
     version number that your file was based on.

     With the `b' command you can run a `diff' on the files
     `.#FILE.VERSION' and `FILE'.  You can get a context- or Unidiff
     by setting `cvs-diff-flags' - *note Customization::..  This
     command only works on files that have status `Conflict' or
     `Merged'.  The name of the command is `cvs-diff-backup'.

Customization
*************

   If you have an idea about any customization that would be handy
but isn't present in this list, please tell me!  *Note Reporting
bugs and ideas:: for info on how to reach me.

`cvs-erase-input-buffer'
     If set to anything else than `nil' the edit buffer will be
     erased before you write the log message (*note Committing
     changes::.).

`cvs-inhibit-copyright-message'
     The copyright message that is displayed on startup can be
     annoying after a while.  Set this variable to `t' if you want
     to get rid of it.  (But don't set this to `t' in the system
     defaults file - new users should see this message at least
     once).

`cvs-cvs-diff-flags'
     A list of strings to pass as arguments to the `cvs diff'
     program.  This is used by `cvs-diff-cvs' (key `d', *note
     Viewing differences::.).  If you prefer the Unidiff format you
     could add this line to your `.emacs' file:

          (setq cvs-cvs-diff-flags '("-u"))

`cvs-diff-flags'
     Like `cvs-cvs-diff-flags', but passed to `diff'.  This is used
     by `cvs-diff-backup' (key `b', *note Viewing differences::.).

`cvs-log-flags'
     List of strings to send to `cvs log'.  Used by `cvs-log' (key
     `l', *note Getting info about files::.).

`cvs-status-flags'
     List of strings to send to `cvs status'.  Used by `cvs-status'
     (key `s', *note Getting info about files::.).

`cvs-auto-remove-handled'
     If this variable is set to any non-`nil' value
     `cvs-remove-handled' will be called every time you check in
     files, after the check-in is ready.  *Note Removing handled
     entries::.

Future enhancements
*******************

   Pcl-cvs is still under development and needs a number of
enhancements to be called complete.  Here is my current wish-list
for future releases of pcl-cvs:

   * Dired support.  I have an experimental `dired-cvs.el' that works
     together with CVS 1.2.  Unfortunately I wrote it on top of a
     non-standard `dired.el', so it must be rewritten.

   * It should be possible to run commands such as `cvs log', `cvs
     status' and `cvs commit' directly from a buffer containing a
     file, instead of having to `cvs-update'.  If the directory
     contains many files the `cvs-update' can take quite some time,
     especially on a slow machine.

   If you miss something in this wish-list, let me know!  I don't
promise that I will write it, but I will at least try to coordinate
the efforts of making a good Emacs front end to CVS.  See *Note
Reporting bugs and ideas:: for information about how to reach me.
