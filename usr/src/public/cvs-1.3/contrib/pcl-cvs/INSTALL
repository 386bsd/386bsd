Installation of the pcl-cvs program
===================================

  1. Edit the file `Makefile' to reflect the situation at your site. 
     The only things you have to change is the definition of
     `lispdir' and `infodir'.  The elisp files will be copied to
     `lispdir', and the info file to `infodir'.

  2. Configure pcl-cvs.el

        There are a couple of paths that you have to check to make
     sure that they match you system.  They appear early in the file
     pcl-cvs.el.

        *NOTE:*  If your system is running emacs 18.57 or earlier
     you MUST uncomment the line that says:

          (setq delete-exited-processes nil)

         Setting `delete-exited-processes' to `nil' works around a bug
     in emacs that causes it to dump core.  The bug was fixed in
     emacs 18.58.

  3. Type `make install' in the source directory.  This will
     byte-compile all `.el' files and copy both the `.el' and the
     `.elc' into the directory you specified in step 1.

        If you don't want to install the `.el' files but only the
     `.elc' files (the byte-compiled files), you can type ``make
     install_elc'' instead of ``make install''.

        If you only want to create the compiled elisp files, but
     don't want to install them, you can type `make elcfiles'
     instead.  This is what happens if you only type `make' without
     parameters.

  4. Edit the file `default.el' in your emacs lisp directory (usually
     `/usr/gnu/emacs/lisp' or something similar) and enter the
     contents of the file `pcl-cvs-startup.el' into it.  It contains
     a couple of `auto-load's that facilitates the use of pcl-cvs.




Installation of the on-line manual.
===================================

  1. Create the info file `pcl-cvs' from `pcl-cvs.texinfo' by typing
     `make info'.  If you don't have the program `makeinfo' you can
     get it by anonymous ftp from e.g. `ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu' as
     `pub/gnu/texinfo-2.14.tar.Z' (there might be a newer version
     there when you read this), or you could use the preformatted
     info file `pcl-cvs.info' that is included in the distribution
     (type `cp pcl-cvs.info pcl-cvs').

  2. Move the info file `pcl-cvs' to your standard info directory. 
     This might be called something like `/usr/gnu/emacs/info'.

  3. Edit the file `dir' in the info directory and enter one line to
     contain a pointer to the info file `pcl-cvs'.  The line can, for
     instance, look like this:

          * Pcl-cvs: (pcl-cvs).       An Emacs front-end to CVS.




How to make typeset documentation from pcl-cvs.texinfo
======================================================

   If you have TeX installed at your site, you can make a typeset
manual from `pcl-cvs.texinfo'.

  1. Run TeX by typing ``make pcl-cvs.dvi''.  You will not get the
     indices unless you have the `texindex' program.

  2. Convert the resulting device independent file `pcl-cvs.dvi' to a
     form which your printer can output and print it.  If you have a
     postscript printer there is a program, `dvi2ps', which does. 
     There is also a program which comes together with TeX, `dvips',
     which you can use.
