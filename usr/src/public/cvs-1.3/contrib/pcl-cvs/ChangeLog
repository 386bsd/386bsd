Tue Apr  7 09:11:27 1992  Per Cederqvist  (ceder@leopold)

	* Release 1.02.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-backup, cvs-edit-done, cvs-status): Call
	save-some-buffers.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-backup-extractor): Fixed syntax error.

	* Makefile, README, compile-all.el, dist-makefile, pcl-cvs.el,
	pcl-cvs.texinfo (XXRELEASEXX): A magic string that is substituted
	for the current release number when a distribution is made.
	(Release 1.01 says that it is release 1.00).

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-find-file): Added missing pair of parenthesis.

Mon Mar 30 14:25:26 1992  Per Cederqvist  (ceder@leopold)

	* Release 1.01.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-parse-buffer): The message when waiting for a
	lock has been changed.

Sun Mar 29 05:29:57 1992  Per Cederqvist  (ceder@leopold)

	* Release 1.00.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-do-update, cvs-sentinel, cvs-parse-buffer):
	Major rewrite of buffer and window selection and handling.  
	The *cvs* buffer is now killed whenever a new "cvs update" is
	initiated.  The -update buffer is replaced with the *cvs* 
	buffer when the update is completed.

Sat Mar 28 21:03:05 1992  Per Cederqvist  (ceder@robin)

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-delete-unused-temporary-buffers): Fixed it.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-auto-remove-handled): New variable.
	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-edit-done): Use it.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Customization, Removing handled entries):
	Document it.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-mode): Turn of the undo feature.  It really
	isn't useful in a cookie buffer...

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-edit-done): Committing a file now looks more
	like diffing a file.  The window handling is better.
	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-use-temp-buffer): The &optional switch is no
	longer needed.

Mon Mar 23 00:20:33 1992  Per Cederqvist  (ceder@robin)

	* Release 0.97.

	* pcl-cvs.el (default-directory): Make sure it always ends in a
	slash. fileinfo->dir does NOT end in a slash, and I had forgotten
	to call	file-name-as-directory in various places.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-backup-extractor): Signal an error if a
	fileinfo without backup file is given.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-mode): Added documentation.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-execute-list): Fix the order of files in the
	same directory.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-log-flags, cvs-status-flags): New variables.
	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-log, cvs-status): Use them.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Customization): Document them.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-backup): Filter non-backup-diffable files
	at an earlier stage, like cvs-commit does.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-flags): New variable.
	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-backup): Use it.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Customization): Document it.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-execute-single-file-list): Remove &rest before
	last argument.  No callers needed updating.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-execute-list): Remove the &rest before the last
	argument (constant-args).  Update all callers of cvs-execute-list
	to use the new calling convention.
	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-cvs-diff-flags): Now a list of strings instead
	of a string.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Customization): Document the change to
	cvs-cvs-diff-flags.

	* Release 0.96.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-cvs-diff-flags): New variable.
	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-cvs): Use it.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Customization, Viewing differences): Document it.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-use-temp-buffe): Don't switch to the temporary
	buffer.  Use display-buffer and set-buffer instead.  This way
	cvs-log, cvs-status, cvs-diff-cvs and friends don't select the
	temporary buffer. The cursor will remain in the *cvs* buffer.

Sun Mar 22 21:50:18 1992  Per Cederqvist  (ceder@robin)

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-find-file, cvs-find-file-other-window): Don't
	prompt when reading in a directory in dired.

	* Makefile (pcl-cvs-$(VER)): Include pcl-cvs-startup.el in the
	distribution.

	* dist-makefile (pcl-cvs.dvi): Don't fail even if texindex does
	not exist.

	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (@setchapternewpage): Changed from 'off' to 'on'.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Variable index): Joined into function index.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Key index): add a description about the key.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo: Many other small changes.
