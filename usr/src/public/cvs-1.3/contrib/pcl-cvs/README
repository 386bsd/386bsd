README,v 1.2 1992/04/07 20:49:09 berliner Exp

This is the readme file for pcl-cvs, release 1.02.

Pcl-cvs is a front-end to CVS version 1.3.  It integrates the most
frequently used CVS commands into emacs.

There is some configuration that needs to be done in pcl-cvs.el to get
it to work.  See the instructions in file INSTALL.

Full documentation is in pcl-cvs.texinfo.  Since it requires makeinfo
2.14 a preformatted info file is also included (pcl-cvs.info).
