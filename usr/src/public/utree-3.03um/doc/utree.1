DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  screen  oriented filesystem browser and utility uuttrreeee
       descends the  directory  hierarchy  rooted  in  your  home
       directory, defined in a tree list file if given, or rooted
       in rroooottddiirreeccttoorryy if given, and displays the directory tree
       on  the  so  called _t_r_e_e _s_c_r_e_e_n.  On the _t_r_e_e _s_c_r_e_e_n uuttrreeee
       lets you walk thru the tree, execute some default and user
       defined  commands on it and change to any directory in the
       tree.
       If you have changed to  a  directory  uuttrreeee  displays  all
       files  in this directory on the so called _f_i_l_e _s_c_r_e_e_n.  On
       the _f_i_l_e _s_c_r_e_e_n uuttrreeee lets you walk thru the file list and
       execute some default and user defined commands on files.

       The  following  command  line  options  are interpreted by
       uuttrreeee:

                       columns (3..9)

       --nn              Avoid scanning the tree for  changes  i.e.
                       after shell escape

       --ll lleevv          Build the tree up to level lleevv for quicker

                       type  command definitions, command history
                       and key bindings

       --pp lliinn          Use lliinn lines for displaying filenames  of
                       the  current  directory on the _t_r_e_e _s_c_r_e_e_n
                       (default: 3)

       --qq              Build the tree up to level 2 (like -l 2)

       --rr              Build the tree scanning  and  reading  the
                       file system instead of reading a tree list
                       file

       --ss              Don't use hardware scrolling

       --uu              Read  and  update  all  file  lists  after
                       building the tree from a tree list file

       --vv mmoodd          Set  using  video  attributes to mode mmoodd.
                       mmoodd may be 22 for all possible, 11 for  bold
                       and   underline   and  00  for  none  video
                       attributes.

       --ww              Suppress warnings about unreadable  direc-
                       tories

       --xx ccmmdd          Use  and execute the string ccmmdd as initial
                       input at startup.  The  string  ccmmdd  is  a
                       simple sequence of uuttrreeee commands

       The  boolean options bbccggnnoossww and the numerical options iippvv
       may also be pre-set in  the  environment  variable  UUTTRREEEE.
       E.g.  if you want to suppress ringing of the bell and dis-
       playing and updating the clock and if you  prefer  a  tree
       indention  of 4 columns set the environment variable UUTTRREEEE
       to 'bbccii44' for this reason.
       Most of the options  correspond  to  uuttrreeee  variables  and
       therefore  they may also be set or unset with the variable
       command (==).  See the sections _g_l_o_b_a_l _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s  and  _v_a_r_i_-

UTREE(1L)                                               UTREE(1L)


       your  home directory uuttrreeee tries to build up the directory
       tree reading a file ..uuttrreeeelliisstt  in  your  home  directory,
       which  contains a list of your directory tree created by a
       previous uuttrreeee session or by the additional  shell  script
       uuttrreeee..mmkklliisstt called before.  If the command line option --ff
       llsstt is given uuttrreeee builds up the tree from this list  file
       llsstt  which  may  be  created with the denoted shell script
       uuttrreeee..mmkklliisstt or a command like ffiinndd.  Entries in such list
       files have to start with the directory separator / (slash)
       in the first column of the line.  All  other  entries  are
       ignored and skipped.

       If  building  the  tree from a list file the file lists of
       directories are created and read in on demand only,  which
       means  when  a  directory becomes the current directory by
       moving the cursor to this directory.  This speeds  up  the
       start  of  uuttrreeee because there is no need for scanning and
       reading the filesystem for subdirectories  what  may  take
       some time for larger filesystems.

       In  all  others  cases,  if no list file is given with the
       command line option --ff llsstt,  rroooottddiirreeccttoorryy  is  rooted  in
       your  home directory and the file ..uuttrreeeelliisstt is not found,
       or the command line option --rr is given uuttrreeee builds up the
       tree  by  scanning and reading the filesystem recursively.
       You can speed up the start with the commandline option  --ll
       lleevv which causes uuttrreeee to build the initial directory tree
       only up to level lleevv similar to the option --ll of the  well
       known  ffiinndd  command.   At  runtime  some commands let you
       expand the directory tree later  and  inspect  directories
       and subtrees not visible at startup (see below).

SSCCRREEEENN LLAAYYOOUUTT
       The  screen is divided into three regions.  The top screen
       line, the so called _e_c_h_o _l_i_n_e is for  displaying  messages
       and entering input.  The second screen line, the so called
       _h_e_l_p _l_i_n_e is for displaying help messages  and  the  uuttrreeee
       default or user defined menu lines.
       The  rest  of  the  screen forms a window on the directory
       tree on the _t_r_e_e _s_c_r_e_e_n or on the file list of the current
       directory  on the _f_i_l_e _s_c_r_e_e_n.  Or he is used for display-
       ing variable or filetype commands settings, for displaying
       help pages and displaying command outputs.

       Many  uuttrreeee commands need some user input for further pro-
       cessing which is done with a builtin simple  line  editor.
       Many  commands  pre-set  the  input  buffer with a default
       input line if this default is known.   For  some  commands
       you  can  use  the  keys  C-n and C-p to scroll in already
       existing input lists and select an input line for  editing
       or  processing  without entering the line completely.  The
       line editor knows about the following functions:


       CCRR,,NNLL               Accept and send the input line

       CC--cc,,CC--yy             Cancel input and leave the line editor

       CC--oo                 Switch  from overwrite-mode to insert-
                           mode or vice versa

       CC--ll                 Redisplay the input line

       CC--ff                 Move the cursor one character forward

       CC--bb                 Move the cursor one character backward

       CC--aa                 Move  the  cursor  to the beginning of
                           the input line

       CC--ee                 Move the cursor  to  the  end  of  the
                           input line

       CC--vv                 Scroll  horizontally forward the input
                           line

       All  other printable characters are appended at the end of
       input line, inserted in insert-mode or overwrite the char-
       acter  under  the  cursor  in overwrite-mode.  The current
       mode is displayed at the end of the help line.  Most  line
       editor commands are also available with function keys, see

       On _f_i_l_e _s_c_r_e_e_n you can execute a file or a command  on  it
       with the uuttrreeee execute command (xx).  You are requested for
       parameters if the current file is executable, for  a  com-
       mand  to  execute  on  the  current file if it is not exe-
       cutable.  For a type of file  you  can  define  so  called
       _f_i_l_e_t_y_p_e  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s  which  are  called if the current file
       matches a given file pattern.
       Filetype commands can be set and unset at startup  in  the
       startupfile  $$HHOOMMEE//..uuttrreeee,  with the commandline option --dd
       or the filetype command (::) similar to setting and  unset-
       ting  variables.   Filetype  commands  are set with a line
       like 'ffiilleettyyppee::ccoommmmaanndd' (i.e. '**..cc::cccc --cc --OO').   The  com-
       mand  (i.e.  'cccc  --cc  --OO') is then executed if the current
       file matches the given file pattern (i.e. '**..cc'  for  a  C
       source  file  ending  with  '..cc').   Filetype commands are
       unset with a line 'ffiilleettyyppee::' (i.e. '**..cc::').
       When defining filetype commands some sprintf  like  format
       characters  lead  in  by a percent sign (%%) have a special
       meaning and are expanded before the command  is  executed.
       For further information about file patterns and the format
       line characters and her meaning see the sections _f_i_l_e _p_a_t_-

       When  defining  a  user tree or file command or a filetype

       line characters and their meaning are:


       %%BB or %%bb            is expanded to the basename  (filename

       Some commands (list, find, grep,  tag  or  untag)  require
       file  patterns  for  matching files using some special (or
       meta) characters.
       Shell like filename pattern matching interprets  the  fol-
       lowing meta characters:


       **                   matches all characters in a filename

       ??                   matches one character in a filename

       [[ccllaassss]]             matches one character from a character
                           class.  A character class includes all
                           characters  enclosed between the open-
                           ing and closing brackets  ([[  and  ]]).
                           If  in a class definition a minus sign
                           (--) is found between two other charac-
                           ters  this  means  the  range from the
                           character  before  and  the  character
                           behind  the  minus sign.  If the first
                           character of a class definition  is  a
                           exclamation mark (!!) this means match-
                           ing of all characters  excluded  those
                           defined in the class, i.e.

       [abc]               matches  the  characters  'a', 'b' and
                           'c'

       [a-z_]              matches the  characters  from  'a'  to
                           'z' and '_'

       [!a-z_]             matches  all  characters except 'a' to
                           'z' and '_'

       File size pattern matching interprets the  following  meta
       characters:


       ==ssiizzee               matches all files of size ssiizzee

       !!ssiizzee               matches all files not of size ssiizzee

       >>ssiizzee               matches all files larger than ssiizzee

       <<ssiizzee               matches all files smaller than ssiizzee

       Size  may  be  specified in bytes (bb, default), kilo bytes
       (kk) or mega bytes (mm), i.e. '>>22kk' matches all files larger
       than 2 kilo bytes or 2048 bytes.


       The  additional  file time pattern matching interprets the
       following meta characters:


       ))ttiimmee               matches all files modified within ttiimmee

       ((ttiimmee               matches  all files not modified within
                           ttiimmee

       Time may be specified in minutes (mm), hours (hh,  default),
       days  (dd) or weeks (ww), i.e. '))22dd' matches all files modi-
       fied within last 2 days.

       To combine shell like filename patterns and/or  additional
       file size and modification time patterns use


       &&                   for AANNDDing of patterns

       ||                   for OORRing of patterns

       If  a character is preceeded by a backslash or enclosed in
       quotes his interpretation is suppressed and he is used  as
       he is.

       as  defined  in  the  environment  variable  TTEERRMM.   These

       keys control keys are defined with  a  leading  caret  (^,
       i.e.  ^x,  ^? means DEL) and some other special characters
       may be defined lead in by a backslash (\).  These  escaped
       characters  and  their  meaning  are: b backspace (^h),  f
       formfeed (^l), n newline (^j), r return (^m), t tab  (^i),
       e  or E escape (^[ or ESC) and s space.  If a backslash is
       followed by up to three digits this defines an octal given
       character.   I.e.  the definition '\e^O\003=END' binds the
       keystring <ESCAPE> <CONTROL-O> <ASCII-3> to the uuttrreeee  key
       or function END.

       The  simplest way to define keys is to switch to the _b_i_n_d_-
       _i_n_g_s _s_c_r_e_e_n and there to do all bindings.  You  have  only
       to hit the key to bind and terminate the key sequence with
       CR or NL.  Therefore CR or NL or key sequences  containing
       CR or NL cannot be bound on the _b_i_n_d_i_n_g_s _s_c_r_e_e_n.  Then you
       have to enter the uuttrreeee name where the key is to bind  to.
       You  can  use  C-n  and C-p to select the wanted name.  At
       last you should give a short comment to the bound key(i.e.
       the  key  name)  for documentation.  If you want to bind a
       key for insertion of a string (and  so  to  bind  function
       keys  to  simple  letter  commands)  you have to enter the
       string  enclosed  in  double  quotes.   I.e.  the  binding
       ''\\eehh==""hh""'' binds the key <ESCAPE> <h> to the string <h> and
       the so called help.  Any bindings you  have  done  on  the
       _b_i_n_d_i_n_g_s  _s_c_r_e_e_n are saved to a file ..uuttrreeee--TTEERRMM into your

       UUTTLLIIBB can be a system default directory containing library
       files (i.e. /usr/local/lib) defined at compile time  or  a
       directory  defined in the environment variable UUTTLLIIBB.  BBIINN
       is a public directory containing  executable  files  (i.e.
       /usr/local/bin)  and  should  be  included  in the command
       search path environment variable PPAATTHH.

BBUUGGSS
       Changes in filesystem after shell escape or editor session
       are not always detected.
       Directory tree depth >32 may be confusing.
       Screen sizes smaller than 80x24 may be confusing.
       Symbolic links to directories may be confusing.
       On  most  BSD systems changing owner and/or group of files
       for normal users is not allowed.
