	    UTREE - screen oriented filesystem utility
	       TODO, klin, Mon Feb 24 20:05:49 1992

->      The system configuration file conf.h and the Makefiles could be
	configured automatically!

->      Instead of really removing files use save-remove with possibility
	to restore so save-removed files, i.e.
		'mv filename .#filename' (instead of 'rm filename')
		'rm .#filename' before exiting utree

->      Extend file patterns, i.e. file mode ...

->      More sophisticated removing of subtrees

->      More sophisticated menu handling

->      Use colors instead of video attributes on color terminals

->      Use of the curses library for screen dependent functions
	instead of own coded functions (???)

->      Port to X11/Motif (???)
