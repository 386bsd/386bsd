.SH NAME
tee \- read from standard input and write to standard output and files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tee
[\-ai] [\-\-append] [\-\-ignore-interrupts] [file...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR tee .
The
.B tee
command copies the standard input to the standard output and any
files given as arguments.
.P
If a file being written to does not already exist, it is created.  If
a file being written to already exists, the data it previously
contained is overwritten unless the
.I \-a
option is used.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-a, \-\-append
Append the standard input to the given files rather than overwriting them.
.TP
.I \-i, \-\-ignore-interrupts
Ignore interrupt signals.
.PP
The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as `\-\-',
for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually support for `+'
will be removed, because it is incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
