.SH SYNOPSIS
.B id
[\-gnruG] [\-\-group] [\-\-name] [\-\-real] [\-\-user] [\-\-groups] [username]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR id .
.B id
prints information about the given user, or the process running it if
no user is specified.  By default, it prints the real user ID, real
group ID, effective user ID if different from the real user ID,
effective group ID if different from the real group ID, and
supplemental group IDs.  It prints each of these values preceded by a
string identifying it and followed by the corresponding user or group
name in parentheses.
.PP
The options cause
.B id
to print only part of the above information.
