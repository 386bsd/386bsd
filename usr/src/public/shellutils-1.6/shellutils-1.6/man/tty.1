This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR tty .
.B tty
prints the path name of the tty connected to its standard input.  It
prints `not a tty' if the standard input is not a tty. Its exit
status is:
.nf
0 if the standard input is a tty
1 if the standard input is not a tty

.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-s, \-\-silent, \-\-quiet
Print nothing; only return an exit status.

The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as `\-\-',
for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually support for `+'
will be removed, because it is incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
