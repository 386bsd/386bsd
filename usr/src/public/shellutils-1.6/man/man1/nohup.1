.TH NOHUP 1L \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
nohup \- run a command immume to hangups, with output to a non-tty
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nohup
command [arg...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR nohup .
.B nohup
runs the given
.I command
with hangup signals ignored and the scheduling priority increased by
5, so that the command can continue running in the background after
you log out.  If the standard output is a tty, it and the standard
error are redirected so that they are appended to the file
`nohup.out'; if that cannot be written to, they are appended to the
file `$HOME/nohup.out'.  If that cannot be written to, the command is
not run.
.PP
If
.B nohup
creates the file `nohup.out' or `$HOME/nohup.out', it creates it with
no access permissions for group or other.  It does not change the
permissions of those files if they already existed.
.PP
.B nohup
does not automatically put the command it runs in the background; you
must do that explicitly, by ending the command line with an `&'.
