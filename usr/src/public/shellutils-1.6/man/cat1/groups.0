       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU version of ggrroouuppss.
       ggrroouuppss prints the names of the supplementary  groups  that
       each  given  _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e,  or the current process if none are
       given, is in.  If user names are given, the name  of  each
       user is printed before the list of that user's groups.

       The  group  lists are equivalent to the output of the com-
       mand `id -Gn'.
