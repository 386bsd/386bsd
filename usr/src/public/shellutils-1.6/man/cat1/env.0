       This manual page documents the GNU version  of  eennvv.   eennvv
       runs  a  command with an environment modified as specified
       by the command line  arguments.   Arguments  of  the  form
       `variable=value'  set the environment variable _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e to
       value _v_a_l_u_e.  _v_a_l_u_e may be empty (`variable=').  Setting a
       variable to an empty value is different from unsetting it.

       The  first  remaining  argument  specifies  a  program  to
       invoke;  it is searched for according to the specification
       of the PATH environment variable.  Any arguments following
       that are passed as arguments to that program.

       If  no command name is specified following the environment
       specifications,  the  resulting  environment  is  printed.
       This is like specifying a command name of `printenv'.

       -_u, --_u_n_s_e_t _n_a_m_e
              Remove  variable  _n_a_m_e  from the environment, if it
              was in the environment.

       -, -_i, --_i_g_n_o_r_e-_e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t
              Start  with  an  empty  environment,  ignoring  the
              inherited environment.

       The  long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well
       as `--', for compatibility with previous releases.   Even-
       tually  support  for  `+'  will  be removed, because it is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
