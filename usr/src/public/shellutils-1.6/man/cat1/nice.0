       This manual page documents the GNU version of nniiccee.  If no
       arguments  are  given,  nniiccee  prints the current sheduling
       priority, which it inherited.  Otherwise,  nniiccee  runs  the
       given  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  with its scheduling priority adjusted.  If
       no _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t is given, the priority  of  the  command  is
       incremented  by  10.  The superuser can specify a negative
       adjustment.  The priority can be adjusted by nniiccee over the
       range of -20 (the highest priority) to 19 (the lowest).

       -_n _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t, -_a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t, --_a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t=_a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t
              Add  _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t instead of 10 to the command's pri-
              ority.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
