       This manual page  documents  the  GNU  version  of  nnoohhuupp.
       nnoohhuupp  runs  the given _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with hangup signals ignored
       and the scheduling priority increased by 5,  so  that  the
       command  can  continue running in the background after you
       log out.  If the standard output is  a  tty,  it  and  the
       standard error are redirected so that they are appended to
       the file `nohup.out'; if that cannot be written  to,  they
       are  appended to the file `$HOME/nohup.out'.  If that can-
       not be written to, the command is not run.

       If    nnoohhuupp    creates    the    file    `nohup.out'    or
       `$HOME/nohup.out',  it  creates  it with no access permis-
       sions for group or other.  It does not change the  permis-
       sions of those files if they already existed.

       nnoohhuupp  does  not  automatically put the command it runs in
       the background; you must do that explicitly, by ending the
       command line with an `&'.
