       This manual page documents the GNU version  of  tteeee.   The
       tteeee command copies the standard input to the standard out-
       put and any files given as arguments.

       If a file being written to does not already exist,  it  is
       created.   If  a file being written to already exists, the
       data it previously contained is overwritten unless the  -_a
       option is used.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -_a, --_a_p_p_e_n_d
              Append the standard input to the given files rather
              than overwriting them.

       -_i, --_i_g_n_o_r_e-_i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t_s
              Ignore interrupt signals.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
