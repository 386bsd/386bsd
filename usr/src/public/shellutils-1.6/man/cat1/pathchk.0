       This  manual  page  documents  the GNU version of ppaatthhcchhkk.
       For each _p_a_t_h, ppaatthhcchhkk prints a message if  any  of  these
       conditions are false:
       o all directories in _p_a_t_h have search (execute) permission
       o the length of _p_a_t_h  <=  the  filesystem's  maximum  path
       length
       o the length of each directory in _p_a_t_h <= the filesystem's
       maximum file name legnth

       The exit status is:
       0 if all path names passed all of the tests,
       1 otherwise.

              Instead of performing length checks on the underly-
              ing filesystem, test the length of the pathname and
              its components against the POSIX.1  minimum  limits
              for portability.  Also check that the pathname con-
              tains no characters not in  the  portable  filename
              character set.

       The  long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well
       as `--', for compatibility with previous releases.   Even-
       tually  support  for  `+'  will  be removed, because it is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
