       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU version of pprriinnttff.
       pprriinnttff prints the _f_o_r_m_a_t string, interpreting  `%'  direc-
       tives  and  `\'  escapes in the same way as the C `printf'
       function.  It interprets `\0ooo'  as  a  an  octal  number
       (`ooo'  is 0 to 3 digits) specifying a character to print,
       and `\xhhh' as a hexadecimal number (`hhh' is 1 to 3  dig-
       its)  specifying  a  character  to print.  It has an addi-
       tional escape, `\c', which causes  pprriinnttff  to  produce  no
       further  output,  and an additional directive, `%b', which
       prints its argument string with  `\'  escapes  interpreted
       the way they are in the _f_o_r_m_a_t string.
