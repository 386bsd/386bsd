       This  manual page documents the GNU version of ddaattee.  ddaattee
       with no arguments prints the current time and date (in the
       format  of  the `%c' directive described below).  If given
       an argument that starts with a `+', it prints the  current
       time  and  date  in  a format controlled by that argument,
       which has the same format as the format string  passed  to
       the `strftime' function.  Except for directives that start
       with `%', characters in that string are printed unchanged.

       The directives are:

       %      a literal %

       n      a newline

       t      a horizontal tab

       Time fields:

       %H     hour (00..23)

       %I     hour (00..12)

       %M     minute (00..59)

       %p     locale's AM or PM

       %r     time, 12-hour (hh:mm:ss [AP]M)

       %S     second (00..61)

       %T     time, 24-hour (hh:mm:ss)

       %X     locale's time representation (%H:%M:%S)

       %Z     time  zone  (e.g., EDT), or nothing if no time zone
              is determinable

       Date fields:

       %a     locale's abbreviated weekday name (Sun..Sat)

       %A     locale's full weekday name, variable  length  (Sun-
              day..Saturday)

       %b     locale's abbreviated month name (Jan..Dec)




                                                                1





DATE(1L)                                                 DATE(1L)


       %B     locale's  full  month  name,  variable length (Jan-
              uary..December)

       %c     locale's date and time (Sat  Nov  04  12:02:33  EST
              1989)

       %d     day of month (01..31)

       %D     date (mm/dd/yy)

       %h     same as %b

       %j     day of year (001..366)

       %m     month (01..12)

       %U     week  number  of  year  with Sunday as first day of
              week (00..53)

       %w     day of week (0..6)

       %W     week number of year with Monday  as  first  day  of
              week (00..53)

       %x     locale's date representation (mm/dd/yy)

       %y     last two digits of year (00..99)

       %Y     year (1970...)

       If  given  an  argument that does not start with `+', ddaattee
       sets the system clock to the time and  date  specified  by
       that argument.  The argument must consist entirely of dig-
       its, which have the following meaning:

       MM     month

       DD     day within month

       hh     hour

       mm     minute

       CC     first two digits of year (optional)

       YY     last two digits of year (optional)

       ss     second (optional)

       Only the superuser can set the system clock.
