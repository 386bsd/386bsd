Important notes:

1. Stuff like "ls *.sdofij 2>/dev/null" to suppress error messages
   produced by the shell don't work anymore.  Filename generation is
   done BEFORE redirection.  To avoid the error message, use the
   nonomatch option, or do "( ls *.sdofij ) 2>/dev/null".

2. History substitution is no longer done inside startup files.  If you
   have sequences like \! or !" in your startup files, they will break.
   (Especially !").  So check for those; remove the !", and change the
   \! to !.
