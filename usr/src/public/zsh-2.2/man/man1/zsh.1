zsh \- the Z shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBzsh\fP [ \(+-\fIoptions\fP ] [ \(+-\fBo\fP \fIoption\fP ] ...  [ \-\fBc\fP \fIstring\fP ] [ \fIarg\fP ... ]
.SH "SHELL GRAMMAR"
A \fIsimple command\fP is a sequence of optional parameter
assignments followed by blank-separated words,
with optional redirections interspersed.
The first word is the command to be executed, and the remaining
words, if any, are arguments to the command.
If a command name is given, the parameter assignments modify
the environment of the command when it is executed.
The value of a simple command is its exit status,
or 128 plus the signal number if terminated by a signal.
.PP
If a simple command is preceded by the word \fBexec\fP,
it is executed in the parent shell without forking.
If preceded by \fBcommand\fP, the command word is taken
to be the name of an external command, rather than a
shell function or builtin.
If preceded by \fBnoglob\fP, filename generation is not performed
on any of the words.  If preceded by a \-, the command
is executed with a \- prepended to its \fBargv[0]\fP string.
If preceded by \fBnocorrect\fP, spelling correction is not
done on any of the words.
.PP
A \fIpipeline\fP is a sequence of one or more commands
separated by \fB|\fP or \fB|&\fP.  \fB|&\fP is shorthand
for \fB2>&1 |\fP.  The standard output of each command is
connected to the standard input of the next command in the
pipeline.
.PP
The value of a pipeline is the value of the last command.
If a pipeline is preceded by a \fB!\fP, the value
of that pipeline is the logical NOT of the value of the last
command.
.PP
If a pipeline is preceded by \fBcoproc\fP, it is
executed as a coprocess; a two-way pipe is established
between it and the parent shell.  The shell can read from or write to
the coprocess by means of the \fB>&p\fP and \fB<&p\fP
redirection operators.
.PP
A \fIsublist\fP is a sequence of one or more pipelines
separated by \fB&&\fP or \fB|\||\fP.  If two pipelines
are separated by \fB&&\fP, the second pipeline is executed
only if the first is successful (returns a zero value).
If two pipelines are separated by \fB|\||\fP, the second is executed
only if the first is unsuccessful (returns a nonzero value).
.PP
A \fIlist\fP is a sequence of one or more sublists
separated by, and optionally terminated by, \fB;\fP, \fB&\fP,
or a newline.
Normally the shell waits for each list to finish before executing
the next one.
If a list is terminated by a \fB&\fP, the shell executes
it in the background, and does not wait for it to finish.
.PP
A \fIcomplex command\fP is one of the following:

The \fBPROMPT3\fP prompt is printed and a line is read from standard
input.  If this line consists of the number of one of the listed
\fIword\fPs, then the parameter \fIname\fP
is set to the \fIword\fP corresponding to this number.
If this line is empty, the selection list is printed again.
Otherwise, the value of the parameter \fIname\fP is set to null.
The contents of the line read from standard input is saved
in the parameter \fBREPLY\fP.  \fIlist\fP is executed
for each selection until a break or end-of-file is encountered.

.SH "RESERVED WORDS"
The following words are recognized as reserved words when used 
as the first word of a command
unless quoted or removed using the \fBunalias\fP builtin:
.RS
.PP
\fBdo done esac then elif else fi for case
if while function repeat time until exec command
select coproc noglob \- nocorrect foreach end\fP
.RE
.SH COMMENTS
In noninteractive shells, or in interactive shells with the
\fBINTERACTIVE_COMMENTS\fP option set, a word beginning
with the third character of the \fBHISTCHARS\fP parameter
(`#' by default) causes that word and all the following
characters up to a newline to be ignored.
.SH ALIASING
Every token in the shell input is checked to see if there
is an alias defined for it.
If so, it is replaced by the text of the alias if it is in command
position (if it could be the first word of a simple command),
or if the alias is global.
If the text ends with a space, the next word in the shell input
is treated as though it were in command position for purposes of alias
expansion.
An alias is defined using the \fBalias\fP builtin; global aliases
may be defined using the \-\fBg\fP option to that bulitin.
.PP
Alias substitution is done on the shell input before any
other substitution except history substitution.  Therefore,
if an alias is defined for the word \fBfoo\fP, alias substitution
may be avoided by quoting part of the word, e.g. \fB\efoo\fP.
But there is nothing to prevent an alias being defined
for \fB\efoo\fP as well.
.SH QUOTING
A character may be \fIquoted\fP (that is, made
to stand for itself) by preceding it with a \e\|.
\e followed by a newline is ignored.
All characters enclosed between a pair of single quotes ('')
are quoted.
A single quote cannot appear within single quotes.
Inside double quotes (""), parameter and command substitution
occurs, and \e quotes the characters \e\|, `, ", and $.
.SH EXPANSION
Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been
parsed.  The types of expansions performed are
\fIfilename expansion\fP, 
\fIprocess substitution\fP,
\fIparameter expansion\fP,
\fIcommand substitution\fP,
\fIarithmetic expansion\fP,
\fIbrace expansion\fP,
and \fIfilename generation\fP.
.SS Filename Expansion
Each word is checked to see if it begins with an unquoted ~.
If it does, then the word up to a / is checked to see if it matches
the name of a named directory.  If so, then the ~ and the matched portion
are replaced with the value of the named directory.
A ~ by itself or followed by a / is replaced by the value of the
\fBHOME\fP parameter.
A ~ followed by a + or a \- is replaced by the value of 
\fBPWD\fP or \fBOLDPWD\fP, respectively.
.PP
Named directories are typically login directories for users on the system.
They may also be defined if the text after the ~ is the name
of a shell parameter whose value begins with a /.
In certain circumstances (in prompts, for instance), when the shell
prints a path, the path is checked to see if it has a named
directory as its prefix.  If so, then the prefix portion
is replaced with a ~ followed by the name of the directory.
The longest match is preferred.
.PP
If a word begins with an unquoted \fB=\fP and the
\fBNO_EQUALS\fP option is not set,
the remainder of the word is taken as the
name of a command or alias.  If a command
exists by that name, the word is replaced
by the full pathname of the command.
If an alias exists by that name, the word
is replaced with the text of the alias.
Otherwise the word is checked up to a /
to see if it is a number or a \-.  If so,
the matched portion is replaced with
the \fIn\fPth directory in the directory stack,
where \fIn\fP is the number matched, or
the last directory in the directory stack
if a \- is matched.
.SS Process Substitution
Each command argument of the form
\fB<(\fIlist\^\fB)\fR
or
\fB>(\fIlist\^\fB)\fR
or
\fB=(\fIlist\^\fB)\fR
is subject to process substitution.
In the case of the
.B <
or
.B >
forms, the shell will run process
.I list
asynchronously connected to a named pipe (FIFO).
The name of this pipe will become the argument to the command.
If the form with
.B >
is selected then writing on this file will provide input for
.IR list .
If
.B <
is used,
then the file passed as an argument will
be a named pipe connected to the output of the
.I list
process.
For example,
.RS
.PP
\fBpaste <(cut \-f1\fP \fIfile1\fB) <(cut \-f3\fP \fIfile2\fB) | tee >(\fIprocess1\fB) >(\fIprocess2\fB)\fR >/dev/null
.RE
.PP
.BR cut s
fields 1 and 3 from
the files
.I file1
and
.I file2
respectively,
.BR paste s
the results together, and sends it to the processes
.I process1
and
.IR process2 .
Note that the file, which is passed as an argument to the command,
is a system
pipe 
so programs that expect to
.BR lseek (2)
on the file will not work.
Also note that the previous example can be more compactly and
efficiently written as:
.RS
.PP
\fBpaste <(cut \-f1\fP \fIfile1\fB) <(cut \-f3\fP \fIfile2\fB) > >(\fIprocess1\fB) > >(\fIprocess2\fB)\fR
.RE
.PP
the shell uses pipes instead of a FIFOs to implement the latter
two process substitutions in the above example.
.PP
If
.B =
is used,
then the file passed as an argument will be the name
of a temporary file containing
the output of the
.I list
process.  This may be used instead of the
.B <
form for a program that expects to \fBlseek\fP(2) on the input file.
.SS Parameter Expansion
The character \fB$\fP is used to introduce parameter expansions.
See \fBPARAMETERS\fP below for a description of parameters.
.PD
.RS
.TP
\fB${\fIname\fB}\fR
The value, if any, of the parameter \fIname\fP is substituted.
The braces are required with \fIname\fP is followed by
a letter, digit, or underscore that is not to be interpreted
as part of its name.
If \fIname\fP is an array parameter, then the values of each
element of \fIname\fP is substituted, one element per word.
Otherwise, the expansion results in one word only; no
word splitting is done on the result.
.TP
\fB${\fIname\fB:\-\fIword\fB}\fR
If \fIname\fP is set and is non-null then substitute its
value; otherwise substitute \fIword\fP.
.TP
\fB${\fIname\fB:=\fIword\fB}\fR
If \fIname\fP is unset and is null then
set it to \fIword\fP; the value of the parameter is then
substituted.
.TP
\fB${\fIname\fB:?\fIword\fB}\fR
If \fIname\fP is set and is non-null, then substitute
its value; otherwise, print \fIword\fP and exit from the shell.
If \fIword\fP is omitted, then a standard message is printed.
.TP
\fB${\fIname\fB:+\fIword\fB}\fR
If \fIname\fP is set and is non-null then substitute
\fIword\fP; otherwise substitute nothing.
.PD 0
.TP
\fB${\fIname\fB#\fIpattern\fB}\fR
.TP
\fB${\fIname\fB##\fIpattern\fB}\fR
.PD
If the \fIpattern\fP matches the beginning of the value of
\fIname\fP, then substitute the value of \fIname\fP with
the matched portion deleted; otherwise, just
substitute the value of \fIname\fP.  In the first
form, the smallest matching pattern is preferred;
in the second form, the largest matching pattern is preferred.
.PD 0
.TP
${\fIname\fB%\fIpattern\fR}
.TP
${\fIname\fB%%\fIpattern\fR}
.PD
If the \fIpattern\fP matches the end of the value of
\fIname\fP, then substitute the value of \fIname\fP with
the matched portion deleted; otherwise, just
substitute the value of \fIname\fP.  In the first
form, the smallest matching pattern is preferred;
in the second form, the largest matching pattern is preferred.
.TP
${\fB#\fIspec\fR}
If \fIspec\fP is one of the above substitutions, substitute
the length in characters of the result instead of
the result itself.  If \fIspec\fP is an array expression,
substitute the number of elements of the result.
.TP
${\fB^\fIspec\fR}
Toggle the value of the \fBRC_EXPAND_PARAM\fP option for the
evaluation of \fIspec\fP.
When this option is set, array expansions of the form
\fIfoo\fB${\fIxx\fB}\fIbar\fR, where the parameter
\fIxx\fP is set to (\fIa b c\fP), are substituted with
\fIfooabar foobbar foocbar\fP instead of the default
\fIfooa b cbar\fP.
.TP
${\fB=\fIspec\fR}
Toggle the value of the \fBSH_WORD_SPLIT\fP option for the
evaluation of \fIspec\fP.
When this option is set, parameter values are split into
separate words using \fBIFS\fP as a delimiter
before substitution.
This is done by default in most other shells.
.PD
.RE
.PP
If the colon is omitted from one of the above expressions
containing a colon, then the shell only checks whether
\fIname\fP is set or not, not whether it is null.
.SS Command Substitution
A command enclosed in parentheses
preceded by a dollar sign, like so: $(...) or quoted with grave
accents: `...` is replaced with its standard output.
If the substitution is not enclosed in double quotes, the
output is broken into words using the \fBIFS\fP parameter.
The substitution \fB$(cat foo)\fP may be replaced
by the equivalent but faster \fB$(<foo)\fP.
.SS Arithmetic Expansion
A string of the form \fB$[\fIexp\fB]\fR is substituted
with the value of the arithmetic expression \fIexp\fP.
\fIexp\fP is treated as if it were within single quotes.
See \fBARITHMETIC EVALUATION\fP below.
.SS Brace Expansion
A string of the form
\fIfoo\fB{\fIxx\fB,\fIyy\fB,\fIzz\fB}\fIbar\fR
is expanded to the individual words
\fIfooxxbar\fP, \fIfooyybar\fP, and \fIfoozzbar\fP.
Left-to-right order is preserved.  This construct
may be nested.  Malformed brace expansion expressions,
including expressions without a comma, are left unchanged
by the shell.
.PP
An expression of the form
\fB{\fIx\fB\-\fIy\fB}\fR,
where \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP are single characters,
is expanded to every character between
\fIx\fP and \fIy\fP, inclusive.
.SS Filename Generation
If a word contains an unquoted instance of one of the characters
*, |, <, [, or ?, it is regarded
as a pattern for filename generation, unless the \fBNOGLOB\fP option is set.
If the \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP option is set, the
^ and # characters also denote a pattern; otherwise
they are not treated specially by the shell.
The word is replaced with a list of sorted filenames that match
the pattern.  If no matching pattern is found, the shell gives
an error message, unless the \fBNULLGLOB\fP option is set,
in which case the word is deleted; or unless the \fBNO_NOMATCH\fP
option is set, in which case the word is left unchanged.
In filename generation,
the character / must be matched explicitly; also, a . must be matched
explicitly at the beginning of a pattern or after a /, unless the
\fBGLOBDOTS\fP option is set.  No filename generation pattern
matches the files "." or "..".  In other instances of pattern
matching, the / and . are not treated specially.
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B *
matches any string, including the null string.
.TP
.B ?
matches any character.
.TP
\fB[ ... ]\fP
matches any of the enclosed characters.
.TP
\fB[^ ... ]\fP
matches any character except the enclosed characters.
.TP
\fB<x\-y>\fP
matches any number in the range x to y, inclusive.
If x is omitted, the number must be less than or equal to y.
If y is omitted, the number must be greater than or equal to x.
A pattern of the form \fB<\->\fP or
simply \fB<>\fP matches any number.
.TP
\fB^x\fP
matches anything except the pattern x.
.TP
\fBx|y\fP
matches either x or y.
.TP
\fBx#\fP
matches zero or more occurrences of the pattern x.
.TP
\fBx##\fP
matches one or more occurrences of the pattern x.
.RE
.PD
.PP
Parentheses may be used for grouping.  Note that the \fB|\fP character
must be within parentheses, so that the lexical analyzer does
not think it is a pipe character.  Also note that "/" has a
higher precedence than "^"; that is:
.RS
.PP
ls
.BI ^ foo / bar
.RE
.PP
will search directories in "." except "./foo" for a file named bar.
.PP
A pathname component of the form
.BI ( foo /)#
matches a path consisting of zero or more directories
matching the pattern foo.
As a shorthand,
.B **/
is equivalent to
.BR (*/)# .
Thus:
.RS
.PP
ls
.BI (*/)# bar
.RE
.PP
or
.RS
.PP
ls
.BI **/ bar
.RE
.PP
does a recursive directory search for files named bar.
.PP
If used for filename generation, a pattern may contain an exclusion
specifier.  Such patterns are of the form \fIpat1\fB~\fIpat2\fR.
This pattern will generate all files matching \fIpat1\fP, but which
do not match \fIpat2\fP.  For example, \fB*.c~lex.c\fP will match
all files ending in .c, except the file \fBlex.c\fP.
.PP
Patterns used for filename generation may also end in a
list of qualifiers enclosed in parentheses.
The qualifiers
specify which filenames that otherwise match the given pattern
will be inserted in the argument list.
A qualifier may be any one of the following:

A "/" at the end of a pattern
is equivalent to "(\|/\|)".
.SH REDIRECTION
Before a command is executed, its input and output
may be redirected.
The following may appear anywhere in a simple-command
or may precede or follow a complex command.
Substitution occurs before
.I word
is used except as noted below.
If the result of substitution on
.I word
produces more than one filename,
redirection occurs for each
separate filename in turn.
.TP
.BI < word
Open file
.I word
as standard input.
.TP
.BI > word
Open file
.I word
as standard output.
If the file does not exist then it is created.
If the file exists, and the
.B NOCLOBBER
option is set,
this causes an error;
otherwise, it is truncated to zero length.
.TP

If the file exists then output is appended to it.
If the file does not exist, and the
.B NOCLOBBER
option is set,
this causes an error;
otherwise, the file is created.
.TP
.BI >>! " word"
Same as
.BR >> ,
except that the file is created if it does not
exist, even if
.B NOCLOBBER
is set.
.TP
\fB<<\fP[\-] \fIword\fP
The shell input is read up to a line that is the same as
.IR word ,
or to an end-of-file.
No parameter substitution, command substitution or
filename generation is performed on
.IR word .
The resulting document,
called a
.IR here-document ,
becomes
the standard input.
If any character of \fIword\fP is quoted with
single or double quotes (a \e alone is \fInot\fP sufficient),
no interpretation
is placed upon the characters of the document.
Otherwise, parameter and command substitution
occurs, \e followed by a newline is removed,
and \e must be used to quote the characters
\e, $, `, and the first character of \fIword\fP.
If <<\- is used, then all leading
tabs are stripped from \fIword\fP and from the document.
.TP
.BI <<< word
Open a file containing \fIword\fP, after expansion,
as standard input.
.TP
.BI <& digit
The standard input
is duplicated from file descriptor
.I digit
(see
.IR dup (2)).
Similarly for standard output using
\fB>&\fIdigit\fP.
.TP
.BI >& word
Same as
.BI > word
\fB2>&\fP1.
.TP
.BI >>& word
Same as
.BI >> word
\fB2>&\fP1.
.TP
.BI <&\-
Close the standard input.
.TP
.BI >&\-
Close the standard output.
.TP
.BI <&p
The input from the coprocess is moved to the standard input.
.TP
.BI >&p
The output to the coprocess is moved to the standard output.
.PP
If one of the above is preceded by a digit, then the file
descriptor referred to is that specified by the digit
(instead of the default 0 or 1).
The order in which redirections are specified is significant.
the shell evaluates each redirection in terms of the
.RI ( "file descriptor" ", " file )
association at the time of evaluation.
For example:
.RS
.PP
\&.\|.\|. \|1>\fIfname\^\fP 2>&1
.RE
.PP
first associates file descriptor 1 with file
.IR fname .
It then associates file descriptor 2 with the file associated with file
descriptor 1 (that is,
.IR fname ).
If the order of redirections were reversed, file descriptor 2 would be associated
with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had been) and then file descriptor
1 would be associated with file
.IR fname .
.PP
If the user tries to open a file descriptor for writing more than once,
the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies
its input to all the specified outputs, similar to tee(1).  Thus:
.RS
.PP
.B date >foo >bar
.RE
.PP
writes the date to two files, named "foo" and "bar".
Note that a pipe is an implicit indirection; thus
.RS
.PP
.B date >foo | cat
.RE
.PP
writes the date to the file "foo", and also pipes it to cat.
.PP
If the user tries to open a file descriptor for reading more than once,
the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies
all the specified inputs to its output in the order
specified, similar to cat(1).  Thus
.RS
.PP
.B sort <foo <fubar
.RE
.PP
or even
.RS
.PP
.B sort <f{oo,ubar}
.RE
.PP
is equivalent to "cat foo bar | sort".  Note that
a pipe is in implicit indirection; thus
.RS
.PP
.B cat bar | sort <foo
.RE
.PP
is equivalent to "cat bar foo | sort" (note the order of the inputs).
.PP
If a simple command consists of one or more redirection operators
and zero or more parameter assignments, but no command name,
the command \fBcat\fP is assumed.  Thus
.RS
.PP
.B < file
.RE
.PP
prints the contents of \fBfile\fP.
.PP
If a command is followed by
.B &
and job control is not active,
then the default standard input
for the command
is the empty file
.BR /dev/null .
Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a command contains the
file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by
input/output specifications.
.SH "COMMAND EXECUTION"
If a command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate
it.  If there exists a shell function by that name, the function
is invoked as described below in \fBFUNCTIONS\fP.  If there exists
a shell builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.
.PP
Otherwise, the shell searches each element of \fBpath\fP for a
directory containing an executable file by that name.  If the
search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an error message and returns
a nonzero exit status.
.PP
If execution fails because the file is not in executable format,
and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a shell
script.  /bin/sh is spawned to execute it.  If the program
is a file beginning with \fB#!\fP, the remainder of the first line
specifies an interpreter for the program.  The shell will
execute the specified interpreter on operating systems that do
not handle this executable format in the kernel.
.SH FUNCTIONS
.PP
The
.B function
reserved word is used to define shell functions.
Shell functions are read in and stored internally.
Alias names are resolved when the function is read.
Functions are executed like commands with the arguments
passed as positional parameters.
(See
.I Execution
below).
.PP
Functions execute in the same process as the caller and
share all files
and present working directory with the
caller.
A trap on
.B EXIT
set inside a function
is executed after the function completes in the environment
of the caller.
.PP
The
.B return
builtin is used to return
from function calls.
.PP
Function identifiers
can be listed with the
.B functions
builtin.
Functions can be undefined with the
.B unfunction
builtin.
.PP
The following functions, if defined, have special meaning to
the shell:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
\fBchpwd\fP
Executed whenever the current working directory is changed.
.TP
\fBprecmd\fP
Executed before each prompt.
.TP
\fBperiodic\fP
If the parameter
.B PERIOD
is set, this function is executed every
.B PERIOD
seconds, just before a prompt.
.TP
\fBTRAPxxx\fP
If defined and non-null,
this function will be executed whenever the shell
catches a signal \fBSIGxxx\fP, where \fBxxx\fP is a signal
name as specified for the \fBkill\fP builtin (see below).
In addition, \fBTRAPERR\fP is executed whenever a command has a non-zero
exit status, \fBTRAPDEBUG\fP is executed after each command, and
\fBTRAPEXIT\fP
is executed when the shell exits,
or when the current function exits if defined
inside a function.
If a function of this form is defined and null,
the shell and processes spawned by it will ignore \fBSIGxxx\fP.
.PD
.SH JOBS
.PP
If the
.B MONITOR
option is set,
an interactive shell associates a \fIjob\fR with each pipeline.
It keeps
a table of current jobs, printed by the
.B jobs
command, and assigns them small integer numbers.
When a job is started asynchronously with
.BR & ,
the shell prints a line which looks
like:
.PP
.DT
	[1] 1234
.PP
indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job number
1 and had one (top-level) process, whose process id was 1234.
.PP
If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the key
\fB^Z\fR (control-Z) which sends a STOP signal to the current job.
the shell will then normally indicate that the job has been `suspended',
and print another prompt.
You can then manipulate the state of this job,
putting it in the background with the
.B bg
command, or run some other
commands and then eventually bring the job back into the foreground with
the foreground command
.BR fg .
A \fB^Z\fR takes effect immediately and
is like an interrupt in that pending output and unread input are discarded
when it is typed.
.PP
A job being run in the background will suspend if it tries to read
from the terminal.
Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output,
but this can be disabled by giving the command ``stty tostop''.
If you set this
tty option, then background jobs will suspend when they try to produce
output like they do when they try to read input.
.PP
There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.
A job can be referred to by the process id of any process of the job
or by one of the following:
.PD 0
.TP
.BI % number
The job with the given number.
.TP
.BI % string
Any job whose command line begins with
.IR string .
.TP
.BI %? string
Any job whose command line contains
.IR string .
.TP
.BI %%
Current job.
.TP
.BI %+
Equivalent to
.BR %% .
.TP
.BI %\-
Previous job.
.PD
.PP
The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state.
It normally informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that
no further progress is possible.  If
.B notify
is not set, it waits until
just before it prints
a prompt before it informs you.
.PP
When the monitor mode is on, each background job that completes
triggers any trap set for
.BR CHLD .
.PP
When you try to leave the shell while jobs are running or suspended, you will
be warned that `You have suspended (running) jobs.'
You may use the
.B jobs
command to see what they are.
If you do this or immediately try to
exit again, the shell will not warn you a second time; the suspended
jobs will be terminated, and the running jobs will be sent
a \fBSIGHUP\fP signal.
To avoid having the shell terminate the running jobs, either
use the \fBnohup\fP(1) command or the \fBdisown\fP builtin (see below).
.SH SIGNALS
The INT and QUIT signals for an invoked
command are ignored if the command is followed by
.B &
and job
.B monitor
option is not active.
Otherwise, signals have the values
inherited by the shell from its parent
(but see the \fBTRAPxxx\fP special function above).
.SH HISTORY
History substitution allows you to use words from previous command
lines in the command line you are typing.  This simplifies spelling
corrections and the repetition of complicated commands or arguments.
Command lines are saved in the history list, the size of which
is controlled by the
.B HISTSIZE
variable.  The most recent command is retained in any case.
A history substitution begins with a
.B !
and may occur anywhere on the command line; history
substitutions do not nest.  The
.B !
can be escaped with
.B \e
to suppress its special meaning.
Single or double quotes will \fInot\fP work for this.
.PP
Input lines containing history substitutions are echoed on the
terminal after being expanded, but before any other
substitutions take place or the command gets executed.
.SS Event Designators
.PP
An event designator is a reference to a command-line entry in
the history list.
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B !
Start a history substitution, except when followed by a blank, newline,
.BR = ,
or
.BR ( .
.TP
.B !!
Refer to the previous command. 
By itself, this substitution
repeats the previous command.
.TP
.BI ! n
Refer to command-line
.IR n .
.TP
.BI ! \-n
Refer to the current command-line minus
.IR n .
.TP
.BI  ! str
Refer to the most recent command starting with
.IR str .
.TP
.BI  !? str\fR[\fP ? \fR]\fP
Refer to the most recent command containing
.IR str .
.TP
.B !#
Refer to the current command line typed in so far.
.TP
.BR !{ .\|.\|. }
Insulate a history reference from adjacent characters (if necessary).
.PD
.RE
.SS Word Designators
.PP
A
.RB ` : '
separates the event specification from the word designator. 
It can be omitted if the word designator begins with a
.BR \*^ ,
.BR $ ,
.BR * ,
.B \-
or
.BR % .
If the word is to be selected from the previous command, the second
.B !
character can be omitted from the event specification.  For instance,
.B !!:1
and
.B !:1
both refer to the first word of the previous command, while
.B !!$
and
.B !$
both refer to the last word in the previous command. 
Word designators include:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B 0
The first input word (command).
.TP
.I n
The
.IR n 'th
argument.
.TP
.B ^
The first argument, that is,
.BR 1 .
.TP
.B $
The last argument.
.TP
.B %
The word matched by (the most recent)
.BI ? s
search.
.TP
.IB x \- y
A range of words;
.BI \- y
abbreviates
.BI 0\- y\fR.
.TP
.B *
All the arguments, or a null value if there is just
one word in the event.
.TP
.IB x *
Abbreviates
.IB x \-$ .
.TP
.IB x \-
Like
.I x*
but omitting word
.BR $ .
.PD
.RE
.SS Modifiers
.PP
After the optional word designator, you can add
a sequence of one or more of the following modifiers,
each preceded by a
.BR : .
These modifiers also work on the result
of filename and parameter expansion.
.RS
.TP
.B h
Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the head.
.PD 0
.TP
.B r
Remove a trailing suffix of the form
.RB ` "\&.\fIxxx" ',
leaving the basename.
.TP
.B e
Remove all but the suffix.
.TP
.B t
Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.
.TP
.B &
Repeat the previous substitution.
.TP
.B g
Apply the change to the first occurrence of a match in each word,
by prefixing the above (for example,
.BR g& ).
.TP
.B p
Print the new command but do not execute it.
.TP
.B q
Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.
.TP
.B x
Like
.BR q ,
but break into words at each blank.
.TP
.B l
Convert the words to all lowercase.
.TP
.B u
Convert the words to all uppercase.
.TP
.BI s/ l / r\fR[\fP / \fR]\fP
Substitute
.I r
for
.IR l .
.PD
.RE
.PP
Unless preceded by a
.BR g ,
the substitution is done only for the
first string that matches
.IR l .
.PP
The left-hand side of substitutions are not regular expressions,
but character strings.
Any character can be used as the delimiter in place of
.BR / .
A backslash quotes the delimiter character.
The character
.BR & ,
in the right hand side, is replaced by the text
from the left-hand-side. 
The
.B &
can be quoted with a backslash. 
A null
.I l
uses the previous string either from a
.I l
or from a contextual scan string
.I s
from
.BI !? s\fR.
You can omit the rightmost delimiter if a newline
immediately follows
.IR r ;
the rightmost
.B ?
in a context scan can similarly be omitted.
.PP
Without an event specification, a history reference refers either to the
previous command, or to a previous history reference on the command line
(if any).
.PP
The character sequence
.BI ^ foo ^ bar
repeats the last command, replacing the string "foo" with the
string "bar".
.PP
If the shell encounters the character sequence
\fB!"\fP
in the input, the history mechanism is temporarily disabled until
the current list is fully parsed.  The
\fB!"\fP
is removed from the input, and any subsequent
.B !
characters have no special significance.
.PP
A less convenient but more comprehensible
form of command history support
is provided by the
.B fc
builtin (see below).
.SH "ARITHMETIC EVALUATION"
An ability to perform integer arithmetic
is provided with the builtin
.BR let .
Evaluations are performed using
.I long
arithmetic.
Constants are of the form
[\fIbase\fB#\^\fR]\fIn\^\fP
where
.I base
is a decimal number between two and thirty-six
representing the arithmetic base
and
.I n
is a number in that base.
If
.I base
is omitted
then base 10 is used.
.PP
An arithmetic expression uses nearly the same syntax, precedence, and
associativity of
expressions in C.
The following operators are supported (listed in decreasing order
of precedence):
.PP
.PD 0
.RS
.TP
.B + \- ! \(ap ++ \-\|\-
unary plus/minus, logical NOT, complement, {pre,post}{in,de}crement
.TP
.B &
logical AND
.TP
.B ^
logical XOR
.TP
.B |
logical OR
.TP
.B * / %
multiplication, division, remainder
.TP
.B + \-
addition, subtraction
.TP
.B << >>
logical shift left, shift right
.TP
.B < > <= >=
comparison
.TP
.B == !=
equality and inequality
.TP

boolean AND
.TP
.B |\|| ^^
boolean OR, XOR
.TP
.B ? :
ternary operator
.TP
.B
= += \-= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= &&= |\||= ^^=
assignment
.TP
.B ,
comma operator
.PD
.RE
.PP
The operators &&, |\||, &&=, and |\||= are short-circuiting,
and only one of the latter two expressions in a ternary operator
is evaluated.  Note the precedence of the logical AND, OR,
and XOR operators.
.PP
Named parameters can be referenced by name within an arithmetic expression
without using the parameter substitution syntax.
.PP
An internal integer representation of a named parameter
can be specified with the
.B integer
builtin.
Arithmetic evaluation is performed on the value of each
assignment to a named parameter declared integer
in this manner.
.PP
Since many of the arithmetic operators require
quoting, an alternative form of the
.B let
command is provided.
For any command which begins with a
.BR (( ,
all the characters until a matching
.B ))
are treated as a quoted expression.
More precisely,
.BR (( ... ))
is equivalent to
.B let
\fB"\fP...\fB"\fP.
.SH "CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS"

.SH PARAMETERS
A parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes.
A name may be any sequence of alphanumeric
characters and _'s, or the single characters
*, @, #, ?, \-, $, or !.
The value may be either a \fIscalar\fP (a string),
an integer, or an array.
To assign a scalar or integer value to a parameter,
use the \fBtypeset\fP builtin.
To assign an array value, use \fBset \-A\fP \fIname\fP \fIvalue\fP ....
The value of a parameter may also be assigned by writing:
.RS
.PP
\fIname\fP=\fIvalue\fP ...
.RE
.PP
If the integer attribute, \-\fBi\fP, is set for \fIname\fP,
the \fIvalue\fP is subject to arithmetic evaluation.
.PP
The value of an array parameter may be assigned by writing:
.RS
.PP
\fIname\fP=(\fIvalue\fP ...) ...
.RE
Individual elements of an array may be selected using a 
subscript.  A subscript of the form \fB[\fIexp\fB]\fR
selects the single element \fIexp\fP, where \fIexp\fP is
an arithmetic expression.  The elements are numbered
beginning with 1.
A subscript of the form \fB[*]\fP or \fB[@]\fP evaluates to all
elements of an array; there is no difference between the two
except when they appear within double quotes.
"$foo[*]" evaluates to "$foo[1] $foo[2] ...", while
"$foo[@]" evaluates to "$foo[1]" "$foo[2]", etc.
A subscript of the form \fB[\fIexp1\fP,\fIexp2\fB]\fR
selects all elements in the range \fIexp1\fP to \fIexp2\fP,
inclusive.
If one of the subscripts evaluates to a negative number,
say \-\fIn\fP, then the \fIn\fPth element from the end
of the array is used.  Thus "$foo[-3]" is the third element
from the end of the array \fIfoo\fP, and
"$foo[1,-1]" is the same as "$foo[*]".
.PP
Subscripting may also be performed on non-array values, in which
case the subscripts specify a substring to be extracted.
For example, if \fBFOO\fP is set to \fBfoobar\fP, then
\fBecho $FOO[2,5]\fP prints \fBooba\fP.
.SS Positional Parameters
Positional parameters are set by the shell on invocation,
by the \fBset\fP builtin, or by direct assignment.
The parameter \fIn\fP, where \fIn\fP is a number,
is the \fIn\fPth positional parameter.
The parameters \fB*\fP, \fB@\fP, and \fBargv\fP are
arrays containing all the positional parameters;
thus \fBargv\fP[\fIn\fP], etc. is equivalent to simply \fIn\fP.

.PD
.RE
.PP
The following parameters are used by the shell:
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B BAUD
The baud rate of the current connection.  Used by the line editor
update mechanism to compensate for a slow terminal by delaying
updates until necessary.  This may be profitably set to a lower value
in some circumstances, e.g.
for slow modems dialing into a communications server which is connected
to a host via a fast link; in this case, this variable
would be set by default to the speed of the fast link, and not
the modem.
This parameter should be set to the baud
rate of the slowest part of the link for best performance.
.TP
.B bindcmds
An write-only array
of command names which take line editor function names
as arguments, and which therefore should allow binding
completion.

.TP
.B HISTCHARS
Three characters used by the shell's history and lexical analysis
mechanism.  The first character signals the start of a history
substitution (default `!').  The second character signals the
start of a quick history substitution (default `^').  The third
character is the comment character (default `#').

.B MAILCHECK
The interval in seconds between checks for new mail. 
.TP
.B mailpath (MAILPATH)
An array (colon-separated list)
of filenames to check for new mail.  Each filename can
be followed by a ? and a message that will be printed.
The sequence $_ in the message will be replaced by the name 
of the mail file.
The default message is "You have new mail."
.TP
.B manpath (MANPATH)
An array (colon-separated list)
whose value is not used by the shell.  The \fBmanpath\fP
array can be useful, however, since setting it also sets
\fBMANPATH\fP, and vice versa.
.TP
.B NULLCMD
The command name to assume if a redirection is specified
with no command.  Defaults to \fBcat\fP.  For sh/ksh-like
behavior, change this to \fB:\fP.  For csh-like

error message if null commands are entered.
.TP
.B optcmds

A trailing space in \fIvalue\fP causes the next
word to be checked for alias substitution.
If the \-\fBg\fP flag is present, define a global alias; global aliases
are expanded even if they do not occur in command position.
For each \fIname\fP with no \fIvalue\fP, print the value of \fIname\fP,

Select a range of commands from \fIfirst\fP to \fIlast\fP from the
history list.
The arguments \fIfirst\fP and \fIlast\fP may be specified as a
number or as a string.  A negative number is used as an offset
to the current history event number.
A string specifies the most recent event
beginning with the given string.
All substitutions \fIold\fP=\fInew\fP, if any, are then performed
on the commands.
If the \-\fBl\fP flag is given, the resulting commands are listed on
standard output.
Otherwise the editor program \fIename\fP is invoked on a file containing
these history events.  If \fIename\fP is not given, the value
of the parameter \fBFCEDIT\fP is used.  If \fIename\fP is "\-",
no editor is invoked.  When editing is complete, the edited
command(s) is executed.  
If \fIfirst\fP is not specified, it will be set to \-1 (the most recent
event), or to -16 if the \-\fBl\fP flag is given.
If \fIlast\fP is not specified, it will be set to \fIfirst\fP,
or to \-1 if the \-\fBl\fP flag is given.
The flag \-\fBr\fP reverses the order of the commands and the

begins with a + or a \-.  An argument not beginning with
a + or a \-, or the argument \-\-, ends the options.
