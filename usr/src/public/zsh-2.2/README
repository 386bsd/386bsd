You have permission to copy the zsh distribution in whole or in part
as long as you don't try to make money off of it, or pretend that you
wrote it.

This is zsh 2.2.0.

To get this shell running, cd into the src directory and type
"buildzsh".  I tested it on the following machines, where it compiled
just by running this script:

Sun SPARCServer 4/690 running SunOS 4.1.2
NeXTstation running Mach 2.0
DECStation-5000 running ULTRIX 4.2
Iris 4D/20 running IRIX 4.0.1
HP 9000/834 running HP-UX 7.00
IBM RS6000 running AIX 3.2
(rumored to work on a Pyramid)

In general, the more BSD-like your system, the more likely it will work.

Tabstops are 3 spaces.  If you're going to look at my code, run it
though "expand -3" first, or set your tab stops to the same as mine.

There is a zsh mailing list, "zsh-list@cs.uow.edu.au".  To have yourself
added to the list, send a request to "zsh-request@cs.uow.edu.au".

The author can be reached via email to one of the following addresses:
"pfalstad@phoenix.princeton.edu", "pfalstad@cs.ucsd.edu", "pf@ttisms.com",
"pf@gnu.ai.mit.edu".

Modification history:

2.2.0-2.1.0:
o should be faster in general
o fewer compilation warnings
o SPROMPT now uses %R instead of %s for the incorrect string
o no longer tries to create FIFOs on NeXTs (thereby causing a panic)
o now gets usernames from NIS on irises without crashing (SGI's getpwnam()
  called my strdup(), the pricks.  Took me forever to find that.  :-) )
o fewer 7-bit assumptions
o which/whence/type have new options:
  -a = all (find all occurences of command in path)
  -c = csh-style which (default for "which" command)
o error message for cd str1 str2 is fixed
o relative paths (including .) in cdpath now work
o exclusion patterns in glob: ls *.c~lex.c prints all .c files but lex.c
o bug with command substitution in chpwd fixed (buffers flushed twice)
o relative paths in $path now work
o "kill -9 -FOO" no longer kills shell
o new options to history/fc:
	-d = prints date commands were entered
	-D = prints running time of commands
o "history <num>" prints all commands SINCE <num> as well
o history stored differently - should be more efficient
o bg'ing a suspended zsh no longer causes problems
o "set" no longer prints ONLY exported params (duh)
o functions +t now allowed
o redirection is done AFTER filename generation
o print changes:
  o print -u# prints to fd #
  o print -p prints to coproc
  o -D and -P perform \ substitution first
  o print -0 changed to print -N
o read changes:
  o read -u# reads from fd #
  o read -p reads from coproc
  o read -z waits for input if nothing on buffer stack
  o no longer reads from fd 0 if shell is getting input from there
  o echo -n foo | read x  now works
o getopts is now POSIX conformant
o compctl builtin added, replacing hostcmds, foocmds, etc.  Controls
  completion of various commands in zle.
  format: compctl -options cmdnams ...
  options tell where to get possible matches from, and include:
	 -c = command names
	 -f = filenames
	 -h = hostnames ($hosts)
	 -o = options
	 -v = vars
	 -b = bindings
	 -k name = elements of $name array
  Any number of these options may be used together.
  In addition, compctl -C -options will set the default completion
  names when in command position (by default -c), and compctl -D -options
  will set the default completion names used after unrecognized commands
  or after redirections (by default -f).
o foo && bar || fuu now works
o ttyctl builtin added
  ttyctl -f freezes the tty.  no changes made to the tty settings by
	 external programs will be honored when this command is in effect.
  ttyctl -u unfreezes the tty.
  typically, "ttyctl -f" would be used in a zlogin or zshrc script after
  "stty" has been called to set up the terminal.
o [[ -e file ]] is now equivalent to [[ -a file ]]
o [[ -h file ]] is now equivalent to [[ -L file ]]
o the path is now hashed incrementally.
  o if the HASHCMDS option is unset, path hashing is not done at all.
  o if the HASHCMDS option is set but HASHDIRS is unset, commands are placed
	 in the hash table when first executed.
  o if the HASHCMDS and HASHDIRS options are both set, commands are placed
	 in the hash table when first executed, along with all commands in
	 the directory that command was found in (and all directories earlier
	 in the path).  This is the default situation.
o "for i (*.c) do /bin/echo $i ; done | more" no longer hangs
o coprocesses now work properly
o READNULLCMD is now used instead of NULLCMD for "< file"
o POSTEDIT is printed whenever the editor exits
o rm path/path/* is now reported by checkrmall()
o cmd >&- works
o cmd >>! file works
o time cmd no longer forks an extra process
o setopt printexitvalue ; echo `false` no longer prints anything
o here documents work inside eval, etc.
o $(...) works inside here documents
o "time" by itself prints the shell timings
o locals in precmd() or chpwd() work
o new glob qualifiers
  o pat(M) sets markdirs, pat(^M) unsets it
  o pat(N) sets nullglob, ...
  o pat(D) sets globdots, ...
o ls * only sorts numeric filenames specially if NUMERICGLOBSORT is set
o setopt braceccl lets "echo {a-zA-Z}" work
o new options: pushdignoredups nohistbeep overstrike
o ls **/file is now equivalent to ls ****/file
o !'s in history are now escaped when you return to them
o history substitution is not done in script files
o echo $(!-2) works
o histverify and correct 'e' no longer put the edit line in the history
o the :x, :q, and :gs modifiers work properly now
o zsh -c 'ls =(ls)' no longer hangs
o VSWTCH is now set to ^Z on the irises
o zsh & no longer causes havoc
o USERNAME and LOGNAME are kept separate
o $manpath has been added for easy access to the $MANPATH components
o zsh now realizes if it is running under emacs, and resigns itself to
  the fact rather than panicking
o SIGQUIT is ignored in the PRODUCTION version of zsh, and kills the shell
  in the DEBUG version, rather than vice versa.
o GLOBALZSHENV has been added, and GLOBALZPROFILE is sourced in the
  proper place
o "kill %" no longer causes the prompt to be printed 3 times if notify
  is set on a NeXT
o REPORTTIME has been added; if a job runs longer than this many seconds,
  timing statistics are reported
o timing statistics now include a job name (%J)
o no longer talks about SIGHUPed jobs if the kill failed
o no longer talks about running jobs which don't exist if you do eval exit
  or if you have notify unset
o foo=bar comman[tab], for/select/foreach i (*.c[tab] both work
o [base]num inside $[...] works
o foo=pat(n|ern) works
o cd - prints the new directory
o l[tab] works if l is an alias
o select foo ; ... works (in $argv is assumed)
o select reads from the right input
o math identifiers can now contain numbers and _'s.
o lots of serious memory heap trashing and leaks fixed
o echo $HOME[*] no longer crashes the shell
o SIGWINCH now changes LINES and COLUMNS in the environment
o typeset +r TTY; TTY=foo no longer causes problems
o ~ substitution is no longer done in FIGNORE
o assignment to SECONDS works
o "else if" is no longer a synonym for "elif" <thud>
o lots of problems with null lists in flow constructs fixed
o no correction done for >file
o echo ${foo%bar is no longer weird
o modifying array substitutions works
o ^O can be bound to something
o command substitution in signal handlers no longer causes problems
o spelling correction is better ($PAHT is corrected), and SPROMPT
  allows all the regular PROMPT escapes
o new prompt escape sequence: %D{...} formats ... part using strftime
o shell input no longer butchered using IFS
o vi cmd mode has 's' bound to visubstitute, as it should be
o you can use ^XS and ^XR in i-search mode
o bindings to ^Z and ^@ work now on the irises
o ^V{^S,^Q,^Z,etc} now works on sgttyb victims
o nopromptclobber changed to nopromptcr
o vi 'u' undo works a little better (?)
o ESC-key bindings aren't screwed up if VISUAL is set to vi
o newline in prompt now works reliably
o vi change and delete work with forward-word/search, etc.
o somewhat suboptimal screen refresh on irises fixed (several seconds
  per character inserted when TERM=xterm??)
o select list printing slightly different
o magic-space's handling of hatchars "fixed"

	- added 'An Introduction to the Z Shell'
