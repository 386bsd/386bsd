HOW TO RELEASE TCSH

1)  Update version number and date in patchlevel.h
2)  Note the new version and date in Fixes
3)  Updated tcsh.man to have the new version and date also
    (two separate lines, with the date in different formats)
4)  Commit changes into CVS
5)  Tag the release with TCSHx_yy_zz where
	x  == REV
	yy == VERS
	zz == PATCHLEVEL
    from patchlevel.h (the new values you picked)
6)  Export the code using the new tag you created.  Rename
    the directory from "tcsh" to "tcsh-x.yy.zz" and create
    tcsh-x.yy.zz.tar.gz (or tcsh-x.yy.tar.gz for public
    releases where zz [PATCHLEVEL] is zero)
7)  Export the previous release as well
8)  Remove files that should not be in a release:
    - Announce*
    - Copyright
    - Makefile.ADMIN
    - RELEASE-PROCEDURE (this file)
9)  Generate a "diff -urN" between the two directories you
    have exported, save it in patchz.gz (z is PATCHLEVEL)
10) Make the patch and the source tarball available on ftp
11) Mail an announcement to tcsh@mx.gw.com
12) Mail the patch to tcsh-diffs@mx.gw.com
