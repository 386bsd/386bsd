   This is for people who do not read the manual!

   So  far  people who don't read manuals don't read this either... I may
   call  it README.*PLEASE* in the future, but then the same people won't
   be able to get ftp it... :-)
     _________________________________________________________________

   1. Why is the meta key broken in tcsh-5.20 and up?

   On  some  machines  the  tty is not set up to pass 8 bit characters by
   default.  Tcsh 5.19 used to try to determine if pass8 should be set by
   looking at the terminal's meta key. Unfortunately there is no good way
   of  determining  if  the terminal can really pass 8 characters or not.
   Consider  if  you  are  logged in through a modem line with 7 bits and
   parity  and  your  terminal  has  a meta key. Then tcsh 5.19 would set
   wrongly set pass8.

   If  you  did like the previous behavior you can add in /etc/csh.login,
   or in .login:

    if ( $?tcsh && $?prompt ) then
        if ( "`echotc meta`" == "yes" ) then
             stty pass8
        endif
    endif

   If you don't have pass8, maybe one of these would work..

    stty -parity -evenp -oddp cs8 -istrip   (rs6000)
    stty -parenb -istrip cs8

   Finally,  tcsh  will  bind  all  printable meta characters to the self
   insert  command.  If  you  don't  want  that  to  happen (i.e. use the
   printable meta characters for commands) setenv NOREBIND.

   2.  I  ran 'dbxtool &' and 'shelltool &' from tcsh, and they end up in
   cbreak and no echo mode?

   These  programs  are broken. Background jobs should not try to look at
   the  tty.  What happens is that dbxtool looks in stderr to inherit the
   tty  setups,  but  tcsh  sets up the tty in cbreak and -echo modes, so
   that  it can do line editing. This cannot be fixed because tcsh cannot
   give away the tty. Pick one of the following as a workaround:

    dbxtool < /dev/null >& /dev/null &
    /usr/etc/setsid dbxtool &

   If that does not work, for dbxtool at least you can add "sh stty sane"
   in your .dbxinit

   3. I tried to compile tcsh and it cannot find <locale.h>?

   Your  system  does  not support NLS. Undefine NLS in config_f.h and it
   should work fine.
     _________________________________________________________________

   4. Where can I get csh sources?

   Csh   sources   are   now   available   with   the  4.4BSD  networking
   distributions. You don't need csh sources to compile tcsh-6.0x.
     _________________________________________________________________

   5. I just made tcsh my login shell, and I cannot ftp any more?

   Newer  versions of the ftp daemon check for the validity of the user's
   shell  before  they  allow  logins.  The list of valid login shells is
   either  hardcoded or it is usually in a file called /etc/shells. If it
   is  hard-coded, then you are out of luck and your best bet is to get a
   newer  version of ftpd. Otherwise add tcsh to the list of shells. [For
   AIX  this  file  is called /etc/security/login.cfg.] Remember that the
   full  path  is  required.  If  there  is  no  /etc/shells, and you are
   creating  one,  remember to add /bin/csh, /bin/sh, and any other valid
   shells for your system, so that other people can ftp too :-)

   6.  I  am using SunView? or OpenWindows? and editing is screwed up. In
   particular  my  arrow  keys  and backspace don't work right. What am I
   doing wrong?

   Well,  cmdtool tries to do its own command line editing and the effect
   you  get  is  one  of  using  an  editor inside an editor. Both try to
   interpret  the arrow key sequences and cmdtool wins since it gets them
   first. The solutions are in my order of preference:

    1. Don't use suntools
    2. Use shelltool instead of cmdtool.
    3. Unset edit in tcsh.

   6b. On a SPARCstation running Solaris 2.x and OpenWindows? 3.1, inside
   a  cmdtool,  the  short-cut  key sequence to clear log (i.e. Meta-e or
   Diamond-e) doesn't work: it just echos 'e' 

   6c.  On  a  SPARCstation  running  Solaris  2.x  and OpenWindows? 3.1,
   maketool  (within SPARCworks) doesn't work: it just does a `cd' to the
   working directory then stops.

   The  workaround  for  6b and 6c is doing "unset edit." Using shelltool
   instead of cmdtool doesn't fix 6c.
     _________________________________________________________________

   7.  I rlogin to another machine, and then no matter what I tell 'stty'
   I cannot get it to pass 8 bit characters?

   Maybe  you  need  to  use  'rlogin  -8'  to  tell rlogin to pass 8 bit
   characters.
     _________________________________________________________________

   8. Where do I get the public domain directory library?

   Anonymous ftp to prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/dirent.tar.Z
     _________________________________________________________________

   9.  I  compiled  tcsh  using  gcc,  and when I start up it says: tcsh:
   Warning  no  access  to tty (Invalid Argument). Thus no job control in
   this shell

   Your  <sys/ioctl.h>  file  is  not  ansi  compliant. You have one of 3
   choices:

    1. Run fixincludes from the gcc distribution.
    2. Add -traditional to the gcc flags.
    3. Compile with cc.
     _________________________________________________________________

   10.  I compiled tcsh with the SunOS? unbundled compiler and now things
   get echo'ed twice.

   It is a bug in the unbundled optimizer. Lower the optimization level.
     _________________________________________________________________

   11. How can I use the arrow keys with hpterm?

   Hp terminals use the arrow keys internally. You can tell hpterm not to
   do that, by sending it the termcap sequence smkx. Since this has to be
   done  all  the  time,  the  easiest thing is to put it as an alias for
   precmd, or inside the prompt:

    if ($term == "hp") then
        set prompt="%{`echotc smkx`%}$prompt"
    endif

   Note that by doing that you cannot use pgup and pgdn to scroll... Also
   if you are using termcap, replace "smkx" with "ks"...
     _________________________________________________________________

   12.  On POSIX machines ^C and ^Z will do not work when tcsh is a login
   shell?

   Make sure that the interrupt character is set to ^C and suspend is set
   to  ^Z;  'stty -a' will show you the current stty settings; 'stty intr
   ^C susp ^Z' will set them to ^C and ^Z respectively.
     _________________________________________________________________

   13.  I  am trying to compile tcsh and I am getting compile errors that
   look like:

    >sh.c:???: `STR???' undeclared, outside of functions [gcc]
    >"sh.c", line ???: STR??? undefined [cc]

   You  interrupted make, while it was making the automatically generated
   headers. Type 'make clean; make'
     _________________________________________________________________

   14. On the cray, sometimes the CR/LF mapping gets screwed up.

   You  are  probably  logged  in  to the cray via telnet. Cray's telnetd
   implements  line  mode  selection the telnet client you are using does
   not  implement  telnet line mode. This cause the Cray's telnetd to try
   to use KLUDGELINEMODE. You can turn off telnet line mode from the cray
   side  by doing a "stty -extproc", or you can get the Cray AIC to build
   a  telnetd  without  KLUDGELINEMODE,  or  you can compile a new telnet
   client  (from  the  BSD net2 tape), or at least on the suns use: 'mode
   character'.

   15.  On AU/X, I made tcsh my startup shell, but the mac desktop is not
   starting up (no X11 or Finder), and I only get console emulation.

   This is another manifestation of item 5. Just add the pathname to tcsh
   in /etc/shells and everything should work fine.
     _________________________________________________________________

   16.  On  machines  that  use  YP (NIS) tilde expansion might end up in
   /dev/null

   If  this happens complain to your vendor, to get a new version of NIS.
   You can fix that in tcsh by defining YPBUGS in config.h
     _________________________________________________________________

   17.  Script on SGI 4.0.5 does not give us a tty, so we cannot have job
   control.

   Their csh does not have job control either. Try:

        % script
        % cat > /dev/tty
     _________________________________________________________________

   18. I start tcsh and it takes a couple of minutes to get the prompt.

   You  have  defined  REMOTEHOST  and your DNS is not responding. Either
   undefine REMOTEHOST and recompile or fix your DNS.
     _________________________________________________________________

   19. If you need help generating your .cshrc file, check out:

     _________________________________________________________________

   20.  On  POSIX  systems  the  kernel  will send hup signals to all the
   processes in the foreground process group if 'stty hupcl' is set.

   For example

    ./tcsh
    echo $$
    591
    ./tcsh
    kill -6 591

   Will kill everything, since hup will be sent to all tcsh processes. To
   avoid that you can set stty -hupcl, but it is not recommended.
     _________________________________________________________________

   21. When I rsh the meta key stops working on the remote machine.

   Try  using rsh -8; this option is undocumented on some systems, but it
   works.  If  that does not work, get and use ssh/sshd. You'll be better
   off from a security point of view anyway.
     _________________________________________________________________

   22.  Tcsh  compiled  under  hp/ux-10.x  does  not pass resource limits
   correctly when ran on hp/ux-11.x systems.

   This  is  a  problem  with  lack  of ABI compatibility between the two
   systems. The only solution is to recompile.
     _________________________________________________________________

   23. Refreshing in command line editing can appear broken on some OS's

   This  is  because  the  termcap/terminfo  description  lies  about the
   ability  of  the  terminal  to  use tabs. At least on Compaq/DEC Alpha
   OSF/1 3.x and 4.x systems, stty -tabs will cause problems.
     _________________________________________________________________

   Everything else is a bug :-(
