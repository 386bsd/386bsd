If you have imake running on your machine, you may skip steps 1 and 2
described in the README file and try instead the process described here.
Note that imake is not supported for all the platforms yet, so this
might not work on your machine. If that is the case please let us know.
If you can send a patch that fixes the problem we would appreciate it.

1. edit imake.config and modify the configurable parameters to your liking.
2. 'xmkmf; make depend; make'
