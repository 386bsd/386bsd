.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mattrib
will add attribute flags to an MSDOS file (with the '+' operator) or
remove attribute flags (with the '-' operator).
.PP
.I Mattrib
will allow the following command line options:
.TP
.B a
Archive bit.  Used by some backup programs to indicate a new file.
.TP
.B r
Read-only bit.  Used to indicate a read-only file.  Files with this bit
set cannot be erased by DEL.  However, 
.I
mdel
is more cunning.
.TP
.B s
System bit.  Used by MSDOS to indicate a operating system file.
.TP
.B h
Hidden bit.  Used to make files hidden from DIR.  However,
.I
mdir
is more cunning.
.PP
MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/' or '\e\'
separator.  The use of the '\e\' separator or wildcards will require the
names to be enclosed in quotes to protect them from the shell.
.PP
The
.I mcd
command may be used to establish the device and the current working
directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the default is A:/.

.SH BUGS
Most versions of ATTRIB don't allow this many options.
