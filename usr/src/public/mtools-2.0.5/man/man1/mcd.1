.TH MCD 1 local
.SH NAME
mcd \- change MSDOS directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mcd
[ msdosdirectory ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Without arguments,
.I mcd
will report the current device and working directory.  Otherwise,
.I mcd
changes the current device and current working directory relative to an
MSDOS filesystem.
.PP
The environmental variable MCWD may be used to locate the file where the
device and current working directory information is stored.  The default
is '$HOME/.mcwd'.  Information in this file is ignored if the file is
more than 6 hours old.
.PP
MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/' or '\e\'
separator.  The use of the '\e\' separator or wildcards will require the
directory name to be enclosed in quotes to protect it from the shell.
.SH SEE ALSO
mdir(1)
.SH BUGS
MSDOS doesn't use CD to change to another device.
.PP
It may be wise to remove old .mcwd files at logout.
