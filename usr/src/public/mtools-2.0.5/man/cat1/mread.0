       mread - low level read (copy) an MSDOS file to Unix

       In  the  first form, _m_r_e_a_d copies the specified MSDOS file
       to the named Unix file.  The second form  of  the  command
       copies multiple MSDOS files to the named Unix directory.

       _M_r_e_a_d will allow the following command line options:

       tt      Text  file transfer.  _M_r_e_a_d will translate incoming
              carriage return/line feeds to line feeds.

       nn      No warning.  _M_r_e_a_d will  not  warn  the  user  when
              overwriting an existing file.

       mm      Preserve the file modification times.

       If  the  target  file already exists, and the -_n option is
       not in effect, _m_r_e_a_d asks whether or not to overwrite  the
       file.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator  or  wild-
       cards  will  require the names to be enclosed in quotes to
       protect them from the shell.

       The _m_c_d command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.

       Unlike MSDOS, the destination directory may nnoott  be  omit-
       ted.
