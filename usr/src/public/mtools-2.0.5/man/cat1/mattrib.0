       _M_a_t_t_r_i_b will add attribute flags to an  MSDOS  file  (with
       the  '+' operator) or remove attribute flags (with the '-'
       operator).

       _M_a_t_t_r_i_b will allow the following command line options:

       aa      Archive bit.  Used by some backup programs to indi-
              cate a new file.

       rr      Read-only  bit.  Used to indicate a read-only file.
              Files with this bit set cannot be  erased  by  DEL.
              However, _m_d_e_l is more cunning.

       ss      System  bit.  Used by MSDOS to indicate a operating
              system file.

       hh      Hidden bit.  Used to make files  hidden  from  DIR.
              However, _m_d_i_r is more cunning.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator  or  wild-
       cards  will  require the names to be enclosed in quotes to
       protect them from the shell.

       The _m_c_d command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.

       Most versions of ATTRIB don't allow this many options.
