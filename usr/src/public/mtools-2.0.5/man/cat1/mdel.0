       _M_d_e_l deletes a file on an MSDOS filesystem.

       _M_d_e_l will allow the following command line option:

       vv      Verbose  mode.  Echo the filenames as they are pro-
              cessed.

       _M_d_e_l  will  ask  for  verification  prior  to  removing  a
       read-only file.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator  or  wild-
       cards  will  require the names to be enclosed in quotes to
       protect them from the shell.

       The _m_c_d command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.
