       _M_r_e_n renames an existing file on an MSDOS filesystem.

       _M_r_e_n will allow the following command line option:

       vv      Verbose mode.  Display the new filename if the name
              supplied is invalid.

       Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS filename.
       If  an  invalid  MSDOS target name is specified, _m_r_e_n will
       change the name (and prompt the user to accept  or  reject
       the new name if the verbose mode is set).

       The path component of the target filename (if supplied) is
       ignored.  In other words, you may not use _m_r_e_n to  move  a
       file from one subdirectory to another.

       _M_r_e_n may be used to rename directories.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator  or  wild-
       cards  will  require the names to be enclosed in quotes to
       protect them from the shell.

       The _m_c_d command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.
