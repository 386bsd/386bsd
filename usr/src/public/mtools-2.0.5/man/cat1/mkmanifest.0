       _M_k_m_a_n_i_f_e_s_t creates a shell script that  will  aid  in  the
       restoration  of  Unix  filenames that got clobbered by the
       MSDOS  filename   restrictions.    MSDOS   filenames   are
       restricted  to  8 character names, 3 character extensions,
       upper case only, no device names, and no  illegal  charac-
       ters.

       The mkmanifest program is compatible with the methods used
       in _p_c_o_m_m, _a_r_c, and _m_t_o_o_l_s to change  perfectly  good  Unix
       filenames to fit the MSDOS restrictions.

       I  want  to  copy  the  following  Unix  files  to a MSDOS
       diskette (using the _m_c_o_p_y command).

            very_long_name
            2.many.dots
            illegal:
            good.c
            prn.dev
            Capital

       _M_c_o_p_y will convert the names to:

            very_lon
            2xmany.dot
            illegalx
            good.c
            xprn.dev
            capital

       The command:

       mkmanifest  very_long_name  2.many.dots  illegal:   good.c
       prn.dev Capital > manifest

       would produce the following:

            mv very_lon very_long_name
            mv 2xmany.dot 2.many.dots
            mv illegalx illegal:
            mv xprn.dev prn.dev
            mv capital Capital

       Notice that "good.c" did not require any conversion, so it
       did not appear in the output.

MKMANIFEST(1)                                       MKMANIFEST(1)


       Suppose I've copied  these  files  from  the  diskette  to
       another  Unix  system,  and  I  now want the files back to
       their original names.  If the file "manifest" (the  output
       captured  above) was sent along with those files, it could
       be used to convert the filenames.
