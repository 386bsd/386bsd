.SH DESCRIPTION
Mtools is a public domain collection of programs to allow Unix systems
to read, write, and manipulate files on an MSDOS filesystem (typically a
diskette).  Each program attempts to emulate the MSDOS equivalent
command as closely as practical.
.PP
MSDOS filenames are optionally composed of a drive letter followed by a
colon, a subdirectory, and a filename.  Subdirectory names can use either
the '/' or '\e\' separator.  The use of the '\e\' separator or wildcards
will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect them from the
shell.
.PP
The regular expression "pattern matching" routines follow the Unix-style
rules.  For example, '*' matches all MSDOS files in lieu of '*.*'.  The
archive, hidden, read-only and system attribute bits are ignored during
pattern matching.
.PP
All options use the '-' (minus) flag, not '/' as you'd expect in MSDOS.
.PP
The
.I mcd
command is used to establish the device and the current working
directory (relative to the MSDOS filesystem), otherwise the default is
assumed to be A:/.

.SH BUGS
An unfortunate side effect of not guessing the proper device (when
multiple disk capacities are supported) is an occasional error message
from the device driver.  These can be safely ignored.
