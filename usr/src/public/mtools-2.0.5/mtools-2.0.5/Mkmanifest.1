.TH MKMANIFEST 1 local
.SH NAME
mkmanifest \- create a shell script to restore Unix filenames
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkmanifest
[ files ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mkmanifest
creates a shell script that will aid in the restoration of Unix filenames
that got clobbered by the MSDOS filename restrictions.  MSDOS filenames
are restricted to 8 character names, 3 character extensions, upper case
only, no device names, and no illegal characters.
.PP
The mkmanifest program is compatible with the methods used in
.I pcomm, arc,
and
.I mtools
to change perfectly good Unix filenames to fit the MSDOS restrictions.
.SH EXAMPLE
I want to copy the following Unix files to a MSDOS diskette (using the
.I mcopy
command).
.PP
.in +0.5i
.nf
very_long_name
2.many.dots
illegal:
good.c
prn.dev
Capital
.fi
.in
.PP
.I Mcopy
will convert the names to:
.PP
.in +0.5i
.nf
very_lon
2xmany.dot
illegalx
good.c
xprn.dev
capital
.fi
.in
.PP
The command:
.PP
mkmanifest very_long_name 2.many.dots illegal: good.c prn.dev Capital >
manifest
.PP
would produce the following:
.PP
.in +0.5i
.nf
mv very_lon very_long_name
mv 2xmany.dot 2.many.dots
mv illegalx illegal:
mv xprn.dev prn.dev
mv capital Capital
.fi
.in
.PP
Notice that "good.c" did not require any conversion, so it did not appear
in the output.
.PP
Suppose I've copied these files from the diskette to another Unix
system, and I now want the files back to their original names.  If the
file "manifest" (the output captured above) was sent along with those
files, it could be used to convert the filenames.
