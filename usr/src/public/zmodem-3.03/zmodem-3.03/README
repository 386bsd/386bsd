May 1989: Corrections for undefined variable and multiply defined rdchk().

New for April 1989:  ZMODEM compression and other compatible extensions
have been added to the rz and sz programs.  Please read the comments in
the rz.c and sz.c source code for licensing information for commercial use.

Previous versions of rz and sz (April 1988) remain Public Domain.

New for April 1988:  VMS C flavors of rz and sz especially for tired
frog stompers.  The following performance log entries give the story!

 2400 Z  splat.arc         3968  220   18  0  0   0  512  30 (rz) 0 ccvax off
 2400 K  splat.arc         3968  110   36  0  0   0   89  -1 get  -1 ccvax off

The contents of RZSZ.ARC can be uploaded to a VAX/XMS system by ZCOMM or
Professional-YAM using the supplied vupl.t script.  Connect to your VMS
system, select an empty directory, and then give the YAM/ZCOMM command:
"source vupl.t".  This will attempt to start a Kermit server ans upload
the files to it.  If the script can't fire up a Kermit server, the
script will use the VMS DCL "create" command to upload the files
directly.  In the latter case, use a clean line for best results.

The contents of RZSZ.ARC can be uploaded to a Unix or Xenix system by
ZCOMM or Professional-YAM using the supplied zupl.t script.  Connect to
your Unix/Xenix system, select an empty directory, and then give the
YAM/ZCOMM command: "source zupl.t".  This will upload minirb.c, compile
it, and then use minirb to upload the rz/sz files.

Once these files are on your Unix system, you can type "make".
The Makefile will list the various systems it knows how to
compile the programs for, and the command to do so (e.g., "make bsd").

The Makefile is self explanatory; just say "make".

Naturally, rz and sz work best with comm programs that seamlessly
support ZMODEM command and file AutoDownload (Pro-YAM and ZCOMM).

The "DSZ" shareware program allows ZMODEM file transfers with
traditional DOS comm programs, but it must be called manually.
(The computer should do that for you!)  DSZ provides a "mini term
function" that supports ZMODEM AutoDownload.  DSZ (part of DSZ.ARC) and
the ZMODEM protocol description (YZMODEM.ARC) are on TeleGodzilla and
other fine bulletin boards.
