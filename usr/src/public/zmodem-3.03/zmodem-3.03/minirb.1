.TH MINIRB 1 OMEN
.SH NAME
minirb \- Bootstrap YMODEM Batch file receive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minirb
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Minirb
receives one or more files with YMODEM batch file transfer protocol.
.I Minirb
was developed for use as a bootstrap to simplify uploading of the longer
.I rz
and
.I sz
programs, such as are contained in the
.I rzsz.zoo
"zoo" archive or the
.I rzsz.sh
shell archive.
.SH SEE ALSO
YMODEM.DOC,
Professional-YAM manual,
sz(omen)
.SH NOTES
The source file
.I minirb.c
has been ruthlessly pruned
(4k, 175 lines)
to simplify uploading without benefit of
an error correcting file transfer protocol.
Do not reformat or add tabs to the source file
as this would complicate uploading.

Please read the uploading suggestions in the chapter
.I "File Transfer Basics"
in the Professional-YAM or ZCOMM user's manual.

.I Minirb
uses 8 bit checksum which may not be compatible with some programs
claiming to support YMODEM batch transfers.

.I Minirb
uses the
YMODEM header
file length information
to avoid storing extraneous characters.
.I Minirb
deletes carriage returns and CPMEOF (^Z) characters
encountered in uploaded files.

.I Minirb
calls stty(1) to set and reset raw tty mode.
