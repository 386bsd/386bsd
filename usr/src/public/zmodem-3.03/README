To install everything, you might use:
cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s /usr/src/public/zmodem-3.03/bin/* .
cd /usr/local/man/cat1; ln -s /usr/src/public/zmodem-3.03/man/cat1/* .

To recompile, cd to the zmodem-3.03 directory and type 'make'.  Gcc
should not report any errors or warnings except;
'ed.inputl.c:516: warning: variable `v' may be clobbered by `longjmp''
which you can ignore.

To reconfigure, type 'sh configure' (or 'bash configure' if you have
bash since it works better with configure than ash does).

The preformatted manpages are in man/cat1.  To regenerate the
preformatted manual pages, cd to man and type 'sh catman'.

The unmodified sources are available via anonymous ftp from
prep.ai.mit.edu in directory /pub/gnu and file zmodem-3.03.tar.Z.
