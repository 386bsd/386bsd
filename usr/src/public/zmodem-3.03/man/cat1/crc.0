       For each file, _c_r_c calculates and prints a 32-bit CRC, the
       byte count, and the file name.  It is  typically  used  to
       validate  files transferred between different systems, and
       is useful in detecting subtle disk corruption.  _C_r_c uses a
       checksum  compatible  with  the DOS version of crc, the 32
       bit CRC used by PKZIP version 0.9, as well  as  the  "crc"
       command  in  ZCOMM  and Professional-YAM (high reliability
       communications programs).

       The 32-bit CRC used is the frame check sequence  in  ADCCP
       (ANSI  X3.66,  also known as FIPS PUB 71 and FED-STD-1003,
       the U.S. versions of CCITT's X.25 link-level protocol).

       Although most unlikely,  files  with  different  data  may
       still produce the same crc value.
