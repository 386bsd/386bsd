       SSzz uses the ZMODEM, YMODEM or XMODEM error correcting pro-
       tocol to send one or more files over a dial-in serial port
       to a variety of programs running under PC-DOS, CP/M, Unix,
       VMS, and other operating systems.


       _S_z is not intended be called from _c_u(_1) or other  communi-
       cations  programs.  Unix flavors of Omen Technology's Pro-
       fessional-YAM communications software  are  available  for
       dial-out applications.  (Reg.)

       SSzz sends one or more files with ZMODEM protocol.

       ZMODEM  greatly simplifies file transfers compared to XMO-
       DEM.  In addition to a  friendly  user  interface,  ZMODEM
       provides  Personal  Computer and other users an efficient,
       accurate, and robust file transfer method.

       ZMODEM provides complete EENNDD--TTOO--EENNDD data integrity between
       application  programs.  ZMODEM's 32 bit CRC catches errors
       that sneak into even the most advanced networks.

       Advanced file  management  features  include  AutoDownload
       (Automatic  file Download initiated without user interven-
       tion), Display of individual and total  file  lengths  and
       transmission  time  estimates,  Crash  Recovery, selective
       file transfers, and preservation of exact  file  date  and
       length.

       The  --yy option instructs the receiver to open the file for
       writing  unconditionally.   The  --aa  option   causes   the
       receiver  to  convert  Unix  newlines  to  PC-DOS carriage
       returns and linefeeds.


       SSbb batch sends one or more files  with  YMODEM  or  ZMODEM
       protocol.   The initial ZMODEM initialization is not sent.
       When requested by the receiver, ssbb supports YYMMOODDEEMM--gg  with
       "cbreak"  tty  mode,  XON/XOFF flow control, and interrupt
       character set to CAN (^X).  YYMMOODDEEMM--gg  (Professional-YAM  gg
       option)  increases  throughput  over  error  free channels
       (direct connection, X.PC, etc.)  by not acknowledging each

       transmitted sector.

       On  Unix systems, additional information about the file is
       transmitted.  If the receiving program uses this  informa-
       tion,  the transmitted file length controls the exact num-
       ber of bytes written to the output dataset, and the modify
       time and file mode are set accordingly.


       SSxx  sends  a single _f_i_l_e with XXMMOODDEEMM or XXMMOODDEEMM--11kk protocol
       (sometimes incorrectly called "ymodem").   The  user  must
       supply  the  file  name to both sending and receiving pro-
       grams.

       Iff sszz is invoked with $SHELL set and  iff  that  variable
       contains  the  string  _r_s_h  or _r_k_s_h (restricted shell), sszz
       operates in restricted mode.   Restricted  mode  restricts
       pathnames  to  the  current  directory and PUBDIR (usually
       /usr/spool/uucppublic) and/or subdirectories thereof.


       The fourth  form  sends  a  single  COMMAND  to  a  ZMODEM
       receiver  for execution.  SSzz exits with the COMMAND return
       value.  If COMMAND includes spaces or  characters  special
       to the shell, it must be quoted.


       The fifth form sends a single COMMAND to a ZMODEM receiver
       for execution.  SSzz exits as soon as the receiver has  cor-
       rectly received the command, before it is executed.


       The  sixth  form  (sz -TT) attempts to output all 256 code
       combinations to the terminal.  In you  are  having  diffi-
       culty sending files, this command lets you see which char-
       acter codes are being eaten by the operating system.


       If sszz is invoked  with  stdout  and  stderr  to  different
       datasets,  Verbose  is  set  to  2, causing frame by frame
       progress reports to stderr.  This may be disabled with the
       qq option.

       The meanings of the available options are:

       \      (backslash)  (VMS)  Force the next option letter to
              upper case.
       ++      Instruct the receiver to append transmitted data to
              an existing file (ZMODEM only).
       aa      Convert  NL  characters  in the transmitted file to
              CR/LF.  This is done by the sender for  XMODEM  and
              YMODEM, by the receiver for ZMODEM.
       bb      (ZMODEM) Binary override: transfer file without any
              translation.

              ceptable  to  MSDOS  or  CP/M)  is  transmitted  as
              C/omenB0000.  If the resultant  filename  has  more
              than 8 characters in the stem, a "." is inserted to
              allow a total of eleven.
       ee      Escape all control characters; normally XON,  XOFF,
              DLE, CR-@-CR, and Ctrl-X are escaped.
       ff      Send  Full  pathname.   Normally directory prefixes

       kk      (XMODEM/YMODEM) Send files using 1024  byte  blocks
              rather than the default 128 byte blocks.  1024 byte
              packets speed file transfers  at  high  bit  rates.
              (ZMODEM  streams  the  data  for  the best possible
              throughput.)
       LL NN    Use ZMODEM sub-packets of length N.  A larger N (32
              <=  N  <= 1024) gives slightly higher throughput, a
              smaller N speeds error recovery.   The  default  is
              128  below  300  baud,  256 above 300 baud, or 1024
              above 2400 baud.
       ll NN    Wait for the receiver to acknowledge  correct  data
              every  NN (32 <= N <= 1024) characters.  This may be
              used to avoid network overrun when XOFF  flow  con-
              trol is lacking.
       nn      (ZMODEM)  Send  each  file if destination file does
              not exist.  Overwrite destination  file  if  source
              file is newer than the destination file.
       NN      (ZMODEM)  Send  each  file if destination file does

              skipping transfer if the destination file exists.
       qq      Quiet suppresses verbosity.
       rr      (ZMODEM) Resume interrupted file transfer.  If  the
              source  file  is  longer than the destination file,
              the transfer commences at the offset in the  source
              file  that  equals  the  length  of the destination
              file.

       The command "sz -T file" exercises the AAttttnn sequence error
       recovery  by  commanding errors with unterminated packets.
       The receiving program should  complain  five  times  about
       binary  data  packets  being  too  long.   Each time sszz is
       interrupted, it should send a  ZDATA  header  followed  by
       another defective packet.  If the receiver does not detect
       five long data packets, the AAttttnn sequence  is  not  inter-
       rupting  the sender, and the MMyyaattttnn string in sszz..cc must be
       modified.

       After 5 packets, sszz stops the "transfer"  and  prints  the
       total  number  of characters "sent" (Tcount).  The differ-
       ence between Tcount and  5120  represents  the  number  of

       Professional-YAM communications software are available for
       dial-out applications.


       If  a  program that does not properly implement the speci-
       fied file transfer protocol causes _s_b to "hang"  the  port
       after a failed transfer, either wait for _s_b to time out or
       keyboard  a  dozen  Ctrl-X  characters.   Every   reported
       instance  of  this  problem  has  been  corrected by using
       ZCOMM, Pro-YAM, DSZ,  or  other  program  with  a  correct
       implementation of the specified protocol.

       Many programs claiming to support YMODEM only support XMO-
       DEM with 1k blocks, and they often don't  get  that  quite
       right.   XMODEM  transfers add up to 127 garbage bytes per
       file.  XMODEM-1k and  YMODEM-1k  transfers  use  128  byte
       blocks to avoid extra padding.

       YMODEM  programs  use  the  file length transmitted at the
       beginning of the transfer to prune the file to the correct
       length;  this  may  cause  problems with source files that
       grow during the course of the transfer.  This problem does
       not  pertain to ZMODEM transfers, which preserve the exact
       file length unconditionally.

       Most ZMODEM options are merely  passed  to  the  receiving
       program;  some  programs  do  not  implement  all of these
       options.

       Circular buffering and a ZMODEM sliding window  should  be
       used  when  input  is  from pipes instead of acknowledging
       frames each 1024 bytes.  If no files  can  be  opened,  sszz
       sends  a ZMODEM command to echo a suitable complaint; per-
       haps it should check for the  presence  of  at  least  one
       accessible file before getting hot and bothered.

       A  few  high  speed  modems have a firmware bug that drops
       characters when the direction of high  speed  transmissson
       is  reversed.  The environment variable ZNULLS may be used
       to specify the number of nulls  to  send  before  a  ZDATA
       frame.   Values of 101 for a 4.77 mHz PC and 124 for an AT
       are typical.

BBUUGGSS
       On at least one BSD system, sz would abend it got within a
       few  kilobytes  of  the  end of file.  Using the "-w 8192"
       flag fixed the problem.  The real cause is  unknown,  per-
       haps a bug in the kernel TTY output routines.

       The  test  mode leaves a zero length file on the receiving
       system.
