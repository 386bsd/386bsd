       This  program  uses  error correcting protocols to receive
       files over a dial-in serial port from a  variety  of  pro-
       grams  running under PC-DOS, CP/M, Unix, and other operat-
       ing systems.  It is invoked from a shell prompt  manually,
       or  automatically  as a result of an "sz file ..." command
       given to the calling program.


       _R_z is not intended be called from _c_u(_1), or other communi-
       cations  programs.  Unix flavors of Omen Technology's Pro-
       fessional-YAM communications software  are  available  for
       dial-out applications.  (Reg.)

       RRzz  (Receive  ZMODEM) receives files with the ZMODEM batch
       protocol.  Pathnames are supplied by the sending  program,
       and  directories  are  made  if  necessary (and possible).
       Normally, the "rz" command is automatically issued by  the
       calling  ZMODEM  program, but some defective ZMODEM imple-
       mentations may require starting _r_z the old fashioned  way.
       _R_z  does  not  support ZMODEM Crash Recovery, compression,
       and other ZMODEM features.  Unix flavors of  Professional-
       YAM  may  be linked to "rz" and used in place of this pro-
       gram to support these ZMODEM features.


       RRbb receives file(s) with YMODEM, accepting either standard
       128  byte sectors or 1024 byte sectors (YAM sb --kk option).
       The user should determine when the 1024 byte block  length
       actually  improves throughput without causing lost data or
       even system crashes.

       If True YMODEM (Omen Technology trademark)  file  informa-
       tion  (file  length,  etc.)   is received, the file length
       controls  the  number  of  bytes  written  to  the  output
       dataset,  and the modify time and file mode (iff non zero)
       are set accordingly.

       If no True YMODEM file information is received, slashes in
       the  pathname  are changed to underscore, and any trailing
       period in the pathname is eliminated.  This conversion  is
       useful for files received from CP/M systems.  With YMODEM,
       each file name is converted to lower case unless  it  con-
       tains one or more lower case letters.

RZ(1)                                                       RZ(1)


       RRxx  receives a single _f_i_l_e with XMODEM or XMODEM-1k proto-
       col.  The user should determine when the 1024  byte  block
       length  actually improves throughput without causing prob-
       lems.  The user must supply the file name to both  sending
       and receiving programs.  Up to 1023 garbage characters may
       be added to the received file.

       GGzz is a shell script which calls _s_z to command Pro-YAM  or
       ZCOMM  to  transmit  the  specified files.  Pathnames used
       with _g_z must be escaped if they have special  significance
       to the Unix shell.
       EXAMPLE: gz "-a C:*.c D:*.h"


       RRzz may be invoked as rrzzCCOOMMMMAANNDD (with an optional leading -
       as generated by login(1)).  For  each  received  file,  _r_z
       will  pipe the file to ``COMMAND filename'' where filename
       is the name of the transmitted file with the file contents
       as standard input.

       Each file transfer is acknowledged when COMMAND exits with
       0 status.  A non zero exit status terminates transfers.

       A typical  use  for  this  form  is  _r_z_r_m_a_i_l  which  calls
       rmail(1)  to post mail to the user specified by the trans-
       mitted file name.  For example,  sending  the  file  "caf"
       from  a  PC-DOS  system  to _r_z_r_m_a_i_l on a Unix system would
       result in the contents of the DOS file "caf" being  mailed
       to user "caf".

       On  some  Unix systems, the login directory must contain a
       link to COMMAND as login sets  SHELL=rsh  which  disallows
       absolute  pathnames.   If invoked with a leading ``v'', _r_z
       will report progress to /tmp/rzlog.  The  following  entry
       works for Unix SYS III/V:
                 rzrmail::5:1::/bin:/usr/local/rzrmail
       If  the  SHELL  environment  variable includes _r_s_h or _r_k_s_h
       (restricted shell), _r_z will not accept absolute  pathnames
       or  references  to  a parent directory, will not modify an
       existing file, and removes any files received in error.

       If rrzz is invoked  with  stdout  and  stderr  to  different
       datasets,  Verbose  is  set  to  2, causing frame by frame
       progress reports to stderr.  This may be disabled with the
       qq option.


       The meanings of the available options are:

       aa      Convert files to Unix conventions by stripping car-
              riage returns and all characters beginning with the
              first Control Z (CP/M end of file).
       bb      Binary (tell it like it is) file transfer override.

NNOOTTEESS
       ZMODEM's support of XOFF/XON flow  control  allows  proper
       operation  in many environments that do not support XMODEM
       uploads.  Unfortunately, not all timesharing systems  sup-
       port  input flow control.  The TTY input buffering on some
       systems may not adequately buffer long blocks or streaming
       input at high speed.  You should suspect this problem when
       you can't send data to the  Unix  system  at  high  speeds
       using ZMODEM, but YMODEM-1k or XMODEM-1k, when YMODEM with
       128 byte blocks works properly.

       The DSZ or Pro-YAM zzmmooddeemm ll numeric parameter may  be  set
       to  a  value between 64 and 1024 to limit the burst length
       ("zmodem  pl128").   Although  this  compromises  ZMODEM's
       throughput,  ZMODEM's superior reliability remains intact.

       If a program that does not properly implement  the  speci-
       fied  file  transfer protocol causes _r_z to "hang" the port
       after a failed transfer, either wait for _r_z to time out or
       keyboard   a  dozen  Ctrl-X  characters.   Every  reported
       instance of this  problem  has  been  corrected  by  using
       ZCOMM,  Pro-YAM,  DSZ,  or  other  program  with a correct
       implementation of the specified protocol.

       Many programs claiming to support YMODEM only support XMO-
       DEM  with  1k  blocks, and they often don't get that quite

       right.

       In the case of a few poorly designed microcomputers, send-
       ing serial data to a tty port at sustained high speeds has
       been known to cause lockups, system halts, kernel  panics,
       and  occasional antisocial behaviour.  This problem is not
       unique to _r_z; CRT terminals with block  mode  transmission
       and  line  noise have the same effect.  When experimenting
       with high speed input to a system, consider rebooting  the
       system  if  the  file  transfers are not successful, espe-
       cially if the personality of the system appears altered.

       The Unix "ulimit" parameter must be  set  high  enough  to
       permit large file transfers to Unix.

       _R_z is not intended be called from _c_u(_1), or other communi-
       cations  programs.  Unix flavors of Omen Technology's Pro-
       fessional-YAM communications software  are  available  for

       _R_z  does  not  support ZMODEM Crash Recovery, compression,
       and other ZMODEM features.  Unix flavors of  Professional-
       YAM may be linked to "rz" to support these features.

       Pathnames  are  restricted  to  127 characters.  In XMODEM
       single file mode, the pathname given on the  command  line
       is still processed as described above.  The ASCII option's
       CR/LF to NL translation merely deletes  CR's;  undos(omen)
       performs a more intelligent translation.

VVMMSS VVEERRSSIIOONN
       The VMS version does not set the file time.

       VMS  C  Standard  I/O  and RMS may interact to modify file
       contents unexpectedly.

       The VMS version does not support invocation as rrzzCCOOMMMMAANNDD ..
       The  current  VMS  version  does  not support XMODEM, XMO-
       DEM-1k, or YMODEM.

       According to the VMS  documentation,  the  buffered  input
       routine  used  on the VMS version of _r_z introduces a delay
       of up to one second for each protocol  transaction.   This
       delay  may  be significant for very short files.  Removing
       the "#define BUFREAD" line from rz.c will  eliminate  this
       delay at the expense of increased CPU utilization.

       For high speed operation, try increasing the SYSGEN param-
       eter TTY_TYPAHDSZ to 256.

       The VMS version causes DCL to generate a  random  off  the
       wall  error message under some error conditions; this is a
       result of the incompatibility of the VMS  "exit"  function
       with the Unix/MSDOS standard.
