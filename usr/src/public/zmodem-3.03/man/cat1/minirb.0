       _M_i_n_i_r_b  receives  one or more files with YMODEM batch file
       transfer protocol.  _M_i_n_i_r_b was  developed  for  use  as  a
       bootstrap  to  simplify  uploading of the longer _r_z and _s_z
       programs, such as are  contained  in  the  _r_z_s_z._z_o_o  "zoo"
       archive or the _r_z_s_z._s_h shell archive.

NNOOTTEESS
       The  source  file _m_i_n_i_r_b._c has been ruthlessly pruned (4k,
       175 lines) to simplify uploading  without  benefit  of  an
       error  correcting file transfer protocol.  Do not reformat
       or add tabs to the source file as  this  would  complicate
       uploading.

       Please  read the uploading suggestions in the chapter _F_i_l_e
       _T_r_a_n_s_f_e_r _B_a_s_i_c_s in the Professional-YAM  or  ZCOMM  user's
       manual.

       _M_i_n_i_r_b  uses  8  bit  checksum which may not be compatible
       with some programs claiming to support YMODEM batch trans-
       fers.

       _M_i_n_i_r_b  uses  the YMODEM header file length information to
       avoid storing extraneous characters.  _M_i_n_i_r_b deletes  car-
       riage  returns  and  CPMEOF (^Z) characters encountered in
       uploaded files.

       _M_i_n_i_r_b calls stty(1) to set and reset raw tty mode.
