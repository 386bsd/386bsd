.TH CRC 1 OMEN 
.SH NAME
crc \- checksum files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B crc
file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
For each file,
.I crc\^
calculates and prints a 32-bit CRC,
the byte count, and the file name.
It is typically used to validate files transferred between
different systems, and is useful in detecting subtle disk corruption.
.I Crc\^
uses a checksum compatible with the
DOS
version of crc,
the 32 bit CRC used by PKZIP version 0.9,
as well as the "crc" command in ZCOMM and Professional-YAM
(high reliability communications programs).

The 32-bit CRC used is the frame
check sequence in ADCCP (ANSI X3.66, also known as FIPS PUB 71
and FED-STD-1003, the U.S. versions of CCITT's X.25 link-level
protocol).

.SH BUGS
Although most unlikely,
files with different data may still produce the same crc value.
