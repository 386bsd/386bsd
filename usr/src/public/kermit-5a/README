To install everything, you might use:
cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s /usr/src/public/kermit-5a/bin/* .
cd /usr/local/man/cat1; ln -s /usr/src/public/kermit-5a/man/cat1/* .

To recompile, cd to kermit-5a and type 'make'.  Gcc should not report
any errors or warnings.

bin/kermit includes all features available for BSD4.3, while
bin/kermit-minimal has minimum size and minimum features.

I defined BSD43 in order to use ioctls, masked IEXTEN out in the
terminal IO c_lflag in order to pass all control and special
characters through (CTRL-v was not being passed though), and ifdefed
out a call to ftime, which is missing on this system.

The kermit sources are available from watsun.cc.columbia.edu
[128.59.39.2] in /kermit/sw/cku179.tar.Z.
