This is kermit version 5A ported to 386bsd.  I've used it for several
weeks now without any troubles.  ckufio.c, ckutio.c and makefile are
in RCS.  Revision 1.1 of each is the virgin sources, and 
revision 1.2 is the version for 396bsd.  To build it type:
co *,v
make 386bsd

then edit the makefile to specify BINDIR and MANDIR, the destinations
for the executable and man page.  Then type 'make install'.  Rich@rice.edu
