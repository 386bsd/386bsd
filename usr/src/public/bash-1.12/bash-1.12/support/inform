Hi.

I have mailed the GNU Bash shell to you since it was hard for you to get
a copy otherwise.  The original files were first tar'ed, then
compressed, then uuencoded, and finally split.

You can get them back together by:

	Saving each mail message WITHOUT THE HEADER in the file
	indicated in the subject line.	When you save the message, make
	certain that each FILE ENDS IN ONE, AND ONLY ONE, NEWLINE.

	Concatenate the files together in lexographic order of their
	names.	This means you type "cat bash-1.xx.tar.Z.uu.*" >bash.tar.Z.uu".

	uudecode bash.tar.Z.uu

	uncompress bash.tar.Z

	tar -xvf bash.tar

This produces a directory called "bash-1.xx".  The full source to bash
resides in this directory.  Now you can read the README file, or the
INSTALL file, or whatever else I saw fit to put in the distribution.

Do not be insulted by this letter.  It is automatically sent to each
person that the shell is mailed to, and is not meant to reflect on any
person's Unix hacking knowledge or expertise.  Hopefully, some people
may have questions answered by it; I certainly would have found a file
such as this one useful the first time I received a set of uuencoded
split files.

If you have suggestions for making the mailing of the shell easier on
end users, or for improvements to this cover letter, please let me know!

Bug reports for bash should be sent to bash-maintainers@ai.mit.edu.
If this doesn't work for some reason, or you need an immediate reply,
you can try sending mail to me.
