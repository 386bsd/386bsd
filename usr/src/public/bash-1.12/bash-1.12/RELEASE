This is a list of user-visible changes between bash version 1.11 and the
previous release, version 1.10, compiled by Chet Ramey.

The shell language

  o If redirections fail for an empty command, the command returns failure
    and changes $?.  If command substitution took place while expanding the
    redirections, the exit status of the command substitution becomes the
    new value of $?.  Previously, $? was unchanged by empty commands.

  o `case' statement pattern lists now allow an optional leading left
    parenthesis.

  o The shell grammar was changed to allow redirections before a ( ... )
    subshell command.

  o Lengthy $PATH searches are now interruptible.

  o A new variable, `command_oriented_history'.  If set, the shell attempts
    to store all lines of a multi-line command (e.g. a while loop or a
    function definition) as a single history entry.

Shell builtins

  o `unalias' now has a -a option, which removes all alias definitions, and
    recognizes `--' as the end of options.

  o If the shell is compiled with DISABLED_BUILTINS defined (look in
    config.h), `builtin xxx' will find xxx even if `enable -n xxx' has
    already been executed.

  o The `fc' output when listing history lines was changed to match the
    Posix.2a specification.

  o `jobs' now has a -x option.  `jobs -x command args' causes the shell to
    replace all job control specifications (e.g. %%, %-) in `args' with the
    appropriate process group identifier and execute `command' with the new
    arguments.

  o `jobs' recognizes `--' as the end of options.

  o There is a new help topic that describes some of the shell variables
    that bash uses.

  o `set -b' is now equivalent to `set -o notify'.

  o `shift' now allows the shift count to be 0, like most versions of sh.

  o On machines that can set a process's maximum number of open files,
    `ulimit -n newval' works as expected.

Readline

  o Dynamic history completion.  Bound to M-TAB in the emacs keymap.  This
    will search the history list for completion strings for a partial
    command.

  o On termios/termio machines, readline no longer unconditionally enables
    8-bit input by disabling ISTRIP -- you have to run `stty -istrip' on
    xterms to use the meta key.  Readline will disable ISTRIP if the tty
    driver indicates that the `character size' is 8 bits:
		(tio.c_cflag & CSIZE) == CS8)

    This was done to make readline usable on machines with hardwired 7-bit
    terminals that put garbage in the eigth bit.

  o An attempt at completion that expands to a single item will now cause
    readline to simply insert that item into the buffer, even if the previous
    command was another completion.  In the last release, completion
    immediately following completion caused readline to list the possible
    completions.

  o The `call-last-kbd-macro' function is now bindable.

  o Readline binds tio.c_cc[VLNEXT] to rl_quoted_insert and tio.c_cc[VWERASE]
    to rl_unix_word_rubout on Posix termios systems that support them.

  o Readline now uses tio.c_cc[VEOF] as the EOF character on termios systems
