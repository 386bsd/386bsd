This README file is in -*- text -*- mode, because Emacs likes it that way.

This is GNU Bash, version 1.12.  Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne
Again SHell, an interactive shell with Bourne shell syntax (/bin/sh);
but also with interactive command line editing, job control on
architectures that support it, Csh-like history features and brace
expansion, and a slew of other stuff.  For more information on the
features of Bash that are new to this type of shell, see the file
`documentation/features.texi'.  There is also a processed DVI file
there, as well as a large man page.

To compile it, try typing `make'.

You may want to read the file INSTALL in this directory for more
information, but I doubt it.

If you are a csh user and wish to convert your csh aliases to Bash
aliases, you may wish to use the script in examples/alias-conv.sh.

Bug reports for 1.12 should be sent to:

	bash-maintainers@ai.mit.edu

The discussion list "bug-bash@ai.mit.edu" often contains information
about new ports of Bash, or discussions of new features or behaviour
changes that people would like.  This mailing list is also available
as a news feed in gnu.bash.bug.

When you send a bug report to bash-maintainers@ai.mit.edu, please
include:

	* the version number of Bash
	* the machine and OS that it is running on (see .machine or .made)
	* a description of the bug
	* a recipe for recreating the bug reliably
	* a fix for the bug if you have one!

While the maintainers of Bash do not promise to fix all bugs, we would
like this shell to be the best that we can make it.

Enjoy!
