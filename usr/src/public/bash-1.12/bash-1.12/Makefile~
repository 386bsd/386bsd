# Makefile for Bash.
# If your cpp doesn't like -P, just get rid of it (the -P, not cpp).
# If you wish to use Gcc, then just type "make CC=gcc".
# If you wish to use GNU's Make, then change the MAKE define.
# If you don't like the destination, then change DESTDIR.  (This only
# matters if you are typing `make install'.)
# The file that you most likely want to look at is cpp-Makefile.
#
# If you haven't read README, now might be a good time.
