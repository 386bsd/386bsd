To install everything, you might use:
cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s /usr/src/public/tcsh-6.01/bin/* .
cd /usr/local/man/cat1; ln -s /usr/src/public/tcsh-6.01/man/cat1/* .

To recompile, cd to the tcsh-6.01 directory and type 'make'.  Gcc
should not report any errors or warnings except:
"ed.inputl.c:516: warning: variable `v' may be clobbered by `longjmp'"
which I've ignored.

The install directories is set to /usr/src/public/tcsh-6.01/{bin,man},
though there are no paths compiled into the executables.  The
preformatted manpages are in man/cat1.  To regenerate the preformatted
manual pages, cd to man and type 'sh catman'.

The unmodified sources are available via anonymous ftp from
tesla.ee.cornell.edu in /pub and from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in the
directory PD6:<UNIX-C.UTILS>.
