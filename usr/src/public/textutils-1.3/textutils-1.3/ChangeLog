	* pr.c  Deleted excess whitespace from ends of lines.
		Modified to work with current version of getopt, which
		returns 1 instead of 0 for non-options.
		Reversed the meaning of the -f option, to be compatable
		with real pr.

Tue Mar 20 14:28:25 1990  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at pogo.ai.mit.edu)

	* comm.c (main): Call usage if given bad option or wrong
	number of args.  Exit with 0 status normally.

	  options specified), to compare the two blocks and count
	  newlines simultaneously.

Tue Feb 20 17:09:19 1990  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at albert.ai.mit.edu)

	* cat.c: Change `argbad' from a char to a short, so it will

	producing output.
	Replace if-else-if constructions with case statements for clarity.
	(bcmp2): Rename `n' to `nread'.
