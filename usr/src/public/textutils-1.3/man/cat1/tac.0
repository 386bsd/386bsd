       This manual page documents the GNU version  of  ttaacc.   ttaacc
       copies  each given file, or the standard input if none are
       given or when a file name of `-' is  encountered,  to  the
       standard  output  with  the order of the records reversed.
       The records are separated by instances of a string,  or  a
       newline  if  none  is  given.   By  default, the separator
       string is attached to the end of the record that  it  fol-
       lows in the file.

       -_b, --_b_e_f_o_r_e
              The  separator  is attached to the beginning of the
              record that it precedes in the file.

       -_r, --_r_e_g_e_x
              The separator is a regular expression.

       -_s, --_s_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r _s_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r
              Use _s_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r as the record separator.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
