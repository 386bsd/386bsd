       This  manual page documents the GNU version of ccoommmm.  ccoommmm
       prints lines that are common, and lines that  are  unique,
       to  two  input files.  The two files must be sorted before
       ccoommmm can be used.  The file name `-'  means  the  standard
       input.

       With  no options, ccoommmm produces three column output.  Col-
       umn one contains lines unique to _f_i_l_e_1,  column  two  con-
       tains  lines  unique  to  _f_i_l_e_2, and column three contains
       lines common to both files.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The options -_1, -_2, and -_3 suppress printing of the corre-
       sponding columns.
