       This  manual page documents the GNU version of uunniiqq.  uunniiqq
       prints the unique lines in a sorted file,  discarding  all
       but  one  of  a  run of matching lines.  It can optionally
       show only lines that appear exactly once,  or  lines  that
       appear more than once.  uunniiqq requires sorted input because
       it compares only consecutive lines.

       If the output file is not specified, uunniiqq  writes  to  the
       standard  output.   If the input file is not specified, it
       reads from the standard input.

              In  this  option, _n_u_m_b_e_r is an integer representing
              the number of fields to skip over  before  checking
              for  uniqueness.   The  first  _n_u_m_b_e_r fields, along
              with any  blanks  found  before  _n_u_m_b_e_r  fields  is
              reached,  are skipped over and not counted.  Fields
              are defined as  a  strings  of  non-space,  non-tab
              characters,  that  are separated from each other by
              spaces and tabs.

              In this option, _n_u_m_b_e_r is an integer represent  the
              number  of  characters to skip over before checking
              for uniqueness.  The first _n_u_m_b_e_r characters, along
              with  any  blanks found before _n_u_m_b_e_r characters is
              reached, are skipped over and not counted.  If  you
              use  both the field and character skipping options,
              fields are skipped over first.

              characters.  Normally the entire rest of the  lines
              are compared.

       The  long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well
       as `--', for compatibility with previous releases.   Even-
       tually  support  for  `+'  will  be removed, because it is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
