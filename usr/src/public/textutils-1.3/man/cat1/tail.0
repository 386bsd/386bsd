       This  manual page documents the GNU version of ttaaiill.  ttaaiill
       prints the last part (10 lines by default) of  each  given
       file;  it  reads from standard input if no files are given
       or when a filename of `-' is encountered.   If  more  than
       one  file  is  given, it prints a header consisting of the
       file's name enclosed in `==>' and `<==' before the  output
       for each file.

       The  GNU  ttaaiill  can  output any amount of data, unlike the
       Unix version, which uses a fixed size buffer.  It  has  no
       -_r  option (print in reverse).  Reversing a file is really
       a different job from printing the end of a file;  the  BSD
       ttaaiill  can  only reverse files that are at most as large as
       its buffer, which is typically 32k.  A reliable  and  more
       versatile way to reverse files is the GNU ttaacc command.

       ttaaiill  accepts  two  option  formats: the new one, in which
       numbers are arguments to the option letters, and  the  old
       one, in which a `+' or `-' and optional number precede any
       option letters.

       If a number (`N') starts with a `+', ttaaiill begins  printing
       with  the Nth item from the start of each file, instead of
       from the end.

       -_c _N, --_b_y_t_e_s _N
              Tail by N bytes.  N is a nonzero  integer,  option-
              ally followed by one of the following characters to
              specify a different unit.

              b      512-byte blocks.

              k      1-kilobyte blocks.

              m      1-megabyte blocks.

       -_f, --_f_o_l_l_o_w
              Loop forever trying to read more characters at  the
              end of the file, on the assumption that the file is
              growing.  Ignored if reading from a  pipe.   Cannot
              be used if more than one file is given.




                                                                1





TAIL(1L)                                                 TAIL(1L)


       -_l, -_n _N, --_l_i_n_e_s _N
              Tail by N lines.

       -_q, --_q_u_i_e_t, --_s_i_l_e_n_t
              Never print filename headers.

       -_v, --_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
              Always print filename headers.

       The  long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well
       as `--', for compatibility with previous releases.   Even-
       tually  support  for  `+'  will  be removed, because it is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
