       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of ssuumm.  ssuumm
       computes a 16-bit checksum for each  named  file,  or  the
       standard  input if none are given or when a file named `-'
       is given.  It prints the checksum for each file along with
       the  number  of  blocks  in the file (rounded up), and the
       file name unless no arguments were given.  By default, the
       GNU ssuumm computes checksums using an algorithm that is com-
       patible with the BSD ssuumm and prints file sizes in units of
       1K blocks.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -_r     Use  the  default (BSD compatible) algorithm.  This
              option is included for compatibility with the  Sys-
              tem V ssuumm.  Unless the -_s option was also given, it
              has no effect.

       -_s, --_s_y_s_v
              Compute checksums using an algorithm that  is  com-
              patible  with  the  one  the  System  V ssuumm uses by
              default and print file sizes in units  of  512-byte
              blocks instead of 1K.

       The  long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well
       as `--', for compatibility with previous releases.   Even-
       tually  support  for  `+'  will  be removed, because it is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
