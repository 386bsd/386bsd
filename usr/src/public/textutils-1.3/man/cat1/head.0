       This manual page documents the GNU version of hheeaadd.   hheeaadd
       prints  the first part (10 lines by default) of each given
       file; it reads from standard input if no files  are  given
       or  when  a  filename of `-' is encountered.  If more than
       one file is given, it prints a header  consisting  of  the
       file's  name enclosed in `==>' and `<==' before the output
       for each file.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       hheeaadd accepts two option formats: the  new  one,  in  which
       numbers  are  arguments to the option letters, and the old
       one, in which the number precedes any option letters.

       -_c _N, --_b_y_t_e_s _N
              Print first N  bytes.   N  is  a  nonzero  integer,
              optionally followed by one of the following charac-
              ters to specify a different unit.

              b      512-byte blocks.

              k      1-kilobyte blocks.

              m      1-megabyte blocks.

       -_l, -_n _N, --_l_i_n_e_s _N
              Print first N lines.

       -_q, --_q_u_i_e_t, --_s_i_l_e_n_t
              Never print filename headers.

       -_v, --_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
              Always print filename headers.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
