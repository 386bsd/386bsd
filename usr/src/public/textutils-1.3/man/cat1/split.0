       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU  version of sspplliitt.
       sspplliitt creates one or more output files (as many as  neces-
       sary)  containing  consecutive  sections of the _i_n_f_i_l_e, or
       the standard input if none is given or  the  name  `-'  is
       given.   By  default,  sspplliitt  puts 1000 lines of the input
       file, or whatever is left if it is less  than  that,  into
       each output file.

       The  output  file  names consist of a prefix followed by a
       group of letters, chosen so that concatenating the  output
       files  in  sorted order by file name produces the original
       input file, in order.  The default output file name prefix
       is  `x'.   If  the _o_u_t_f_i_l_e-_p_r_e_f_i_x argument is given, it is
       used as the output file name prefix instead.

              Put _l_i_n_e_s lines of the input file into each  output
              file.

       -_b _b_y_t_e_s[_b_k_m], --_b_y_t_e_s=_b_y_t_e_s[_b_k_m]
              Put  _b_y_t_e_s bytes of the input file into each output
              file.  _b_y_t_e_s is a nonzero integer, optionally  fol-
              lowed by one of the following characters to specify
              a different unit.

              b      512-byte blocks.

              k      1-kilobyte blocks.

              m      1-megabyte blocks.

       -_C _b_y_t_e_s[_b_k_m], --_l_i_n_e-_b_y_t_e_s=_b_y_t_e_s[_b_k_m]
              Put into each output file as many complete lines of
              the  input  file  as  is possible without exceeding
              _b_y_t_e_s bytes.  If a line that is longer  than  _b_y_t_e_s
              bytes  occurs, put _b_y_t_e_s bytes of it into each out-
              put file until less than _b_y_t_e_s bytes  of  the  line
              are  left,  then  continue normally.  _b_y_t_e_s has the
              same format as for the --_b_y_t_e_s option.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
