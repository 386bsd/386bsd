       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of ccuutt.  ccuutt
       prints sections of each line of each input  file,  or  the
       standard  input if no files are given.  A file name of `-'
       means standard  input.   Which  sections  are  printed  is
       selected by the options.

       The  _b_y_t_e-_l_i_s_t,  _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r-_l_i_s_t, and _f_i_e_l_d-_l_i_s_t are one or
       more numbers or ranges (two numbers separated by  a  dash)
       separated by commas.  The first byte, character, and field
       are numbered 1.  Incomplete  ranges  may  be  given:  `-m'
       means  `1-m';  `n-'  means `n' through end of line or last
       field.

       -_b, --_b_y_t_e_s _b_y_t_e-_l_i_s_t
              Print only the bytes in positions listed  in  _b_y_t_e-
              _l_i_s_t.   Tabs  and  backspaces  are treated like any
              other character; they take up 1 byte.

       -_c, --_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r-_l_i_s_t
              Print only characters in positions listed in  _c_h_a_r-
              _a_c_t_e_r-_l_i_s_t.   The  same as -b for now, but interna-
              tionalization   will   change   that.    Tabs   and
              backspaces  are  treated  like any other character;
              they take up 1 character.

       -_f, --_f_i_e_l_d_s _f_i_e_l_d-_l_i_s_t
              Print only the fields listed in _f_i_e_l_d-_l_i_s_t.  Fields
              are separated by a TAB by default.

       -_d, --_d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r _d_e_l_i_m
              For -f, fields are separated by the first character
              in _d_e_l_i_m instead of by TAB.

       -_n     Do not split multibyte characters (no-op for  now).

       -_s, --_o_n_l_y-_d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_d
              For  -f, do not print lines that do not contain the
              field separator character.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well



                                                                1

       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
