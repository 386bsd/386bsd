       This manual page  documents  the  GNU  version  of  ppaassttee.
       ppaassttee  prints lines consisting of sequentially correspond-
       ing lines of each given file, separated  by  TABs,  termi-
       nated  by  a newline.  If no files are given, the standard
       input is used.  A file name of `-' means standard input.

       -_s, --_s_e_r_i_a_l
              Paste the lines of one file at a time  rather  than
              one line from each file.

       -_d, --_d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s _d_e_l_i_m-_l_i_s_t
              Consecutively  use  the  characters  in  _d_e_l_i_m-_l_i_s_t
              instead of TAB  to  separate  merged  lines.   When
              _d_e_l_i_m-_l_i_s_t  is exhausted, start again at its begin-
              ning.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
