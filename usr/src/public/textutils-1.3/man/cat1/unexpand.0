       This manual page documents the GNU  version  of  uunneexxppaanndd.
       uunneexxppaanndd  writes  the  contents of each given file, or the
       standard input if none are given or when a file named  `-'
       is  given,  to the standard output, with strings of two or
       more space or tab characters converted to as many tabs  as
       possible  followed  by  as  many spaces as are needed.  By
       default, uunneexxppaanndd converts only initial  spaces  and  tabs
       (those  that  precede  all non space or tab characters) on
       each line.  It preserves backspace characters in the  out-
       put; they decrement the column count for tab calculations.
       By default, tabs are set at every 8th column.

       -, -_t, --_t_a_b_s _t_a_b_1[,_t_a_b_2[,...]]
              If only one tab stop is given, set  the  tabs  _t_a_b_1
              spaces  apart instead of the default 8.  Otherwise,
              set the tabs at columns _t_a_b_1, _t_a_b_2, etc.  (numbered
              from  0)  and leave spaces and tabs beyond the tab-
              stops given unchanged.  If the tabstops are  speci-
              fied with the -_t or --_t_a_b_s option, they can be sep-
              arated by blanks as well as by commas.  This option
              implies the -_a option.

       -_a, --_a_l_l
              Convert  all strings of two or more spaces or tabs,
              not just initial ones, to tabs.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
