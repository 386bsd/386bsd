       This manual page documents the GNU version  of  ccmmpp.   ccmmpp
       compares  the  two  given files, and if they differ, tells
       the first byte and line number  where  they  differ.   The
       file  name  `-' is always the standard input.  If one file
       name is omitted, the standard input is used as well.

       It exits with the value

       0      The files are identical.

       1      The files differ.

       2      An error occurred.

       -_c, --_s_h_o_w-_c_h_a_r_s
              Print  the  differing  characters  like  `cat   -t'
              (except that newlines are printed as `^J').

       -_l, --_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
              Print  the  (decimal) offsets and (octal) values of
              all differing bytes.

       -_s, --_s_i_l_e_n_t, --_q_u_i_e_t
              Do not print anything; only return an  exit  status
              indicating whether the files differ.

       The  long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well
       as `--', for compatibility with previous releases.   Even-
       tually  support  for  `+'  will  be removed, because it is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
