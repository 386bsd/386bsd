.SH NAME
fold \- wrap each input line to fit in specified width
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fold
[\-bs] [\-w width] [\-\-bytes] [\-\-spaces] [\-\-width=width] [file...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR fold .
.B fold
prints the specified files, or the standard input when no files are
given or the filename `\-' is encountered, on the standard output.  It
breaks long lines into multiple shorter lines by inserting a newline
at column 80.  It counts screen columns, so tab characters usually
take more than one column, backspace characters decrease the column
count, and carriage return characters set the column count back to zero.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-b, \-\-bytes"
Count bytes rather than columns, so that tabs, backspaces, and
carriage returns are each counted as taking up one column, just like
other characters.
.TP
.I "\-s, \-\-spaces"
Break at word boundaries.  If the line contains any blanks, the line
is broken after the last blank that falls within the maximum line
length.  If there are no blanks, the line is broken at the maximum
line length, as usual.
.TP
.I "\-w, \-\-width width"
Use a maximum line length of
.I width
columns instead of 80.
.PP
The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as `\-\-',
for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually support for `+'
will be removed, because it is incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
