This port of screen3.2 is based on patches by Brad Morrison
(brad@NeoSoft.com) posted to comp.unix.bsd 18 May 1992.

To install everything, you might use:
cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s /usr/src/public/screen-3.2/bin/* .
cd /usr/local/man/cat1; ln -s /usr/src/public/screen-3.2/man/cat1/* .

To recompile, cd to the screen-3.2 directory and type 'make'.  Gcc
should not report any errors or warnings.

In order to test it, copy .iscreen to your home directory.
See screen3.2/readme for brief instructions on testing.

The install directories is set to
/usr/src/public/screen-3.2/{bin,man}, though there are no paths
compiled into the executables.  The preformatted manpages are in
man/cat1.  To regenerate the preformatted manual pages, cd to man and
type 'sh catman'.

Screen 3.2 is under the GNU copyleft and was posted to
comp.sources.misc as screen-3.2/part* in February of 1992.
