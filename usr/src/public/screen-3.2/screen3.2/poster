This is iScreen version 3.2. It is an upgrade to version 3.1.1 that was posted
in dec 91 to comp.sources.unix. 
Versions 3.1.x of iScreen are potential security riscs under SunOS 4.1.1. These
versions fail to detach or terminate the session when the modem line hangs up.
Anyone using telnet or rlogin could (unwillingly) connect to such a session.

iScreen users on SunOS 4.1.1 please do upgrade to version 3.2! 

Although fixing the bug described above was the main reason for this posting,
there are numerous other fixes/enhancements:

	* support for NeXT, Apollo, Ultrix, SVR4, SCO, ISC, SGI, bsd386, ...
	  added or enhanced. 
	
	* the "dead CTRL-O key" bug is fixed.
	
	* flow control has been redesigned.
	
	* I/O is no longer stripped to 7 bit.
	
	* new commands "hardcopy_append on", "bufferfile /tmp/myown", 
	  "(set) refresh off".
	  
	* redesign of interrupt passing. The use of "screen -i" is now 
	  encouraged.
	
	* overall code cleanup.
	
The complete distribution of iScreen 3.2 is available via ftp from:

   ftp.uni-erlangen.de[131.188.1.43]:portal/utilities/screen/screen32.tar.Z
   
For a brief introduction and a short summary of essential commands
refer to the files "readme" and "README".
   
I wish to thank all contributors for requesting features or sending patches.
Special thanks to Marc Boucher who tested and patched iScreen on numerous
platforms.
