Installation of screen3.1

0.)
Unpack. Screen comes as a compressed tar archinve. But... you propably
already managed that step, when you are reading this.

1.)
take a look at the config directory. choose one of the config files there,
or edit one to suit your needs. If necessary cunsult the online manuals
or look into /usr/include/...

2.)
look at the Makefiles. Different systems need different libraries. 
Some need even the putenv code added. Build a Makefile that satisfies
all these requirements. Then decide if you want to do screen debugging
or want a production screen. In the first case you want to add -DDEBUG
to CFLAGS. In the second case you may want to have -O in your CFLAGS
and -s in your LDFLAGS, as you don't want to analyse a core-dump, if
that ever happens. Still the executable may be 250 to 500 kbytes in size.

3.)
compile with the right compiler. If you have gcc, use it. If you have 
a SYSV-ish and a bsd-like compiler, choose the later. E.g. on suns screen
will not run properly when compiled with /usr/5bin/cc.

4.)
You may well run screen from your private binary directory and with a 
private socket directory like $HOME/.screen. But to have a full featured
screen and (from a users point of view) more secure pty's you should
consult a system administrator and discuss installing screen setuid-root
in some globally accessible directory like /usr/local/bin.
