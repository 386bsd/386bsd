This directory contains publically accessible software that has
been made to function with 386BSD Release 0.1 . The work to accomplish
these various ports of software has been contributed by many tireless
volunteers, and amounts to a major body of valuable code that is
directly usable by those running 386BSD. It is provided as a
convience to 386BSD users, and as a place to focus further development
of these and still more future public access software.

These packages are provided as-is, and many are undergoing continual
development. They vary greatly in terms of quality, performance,
and "support". Some are in daily use by maintainers with 386BSD,
others are barely used, and we don't have a clear idea as to which
is which.

This is *not* a general purpose software repository, this is solely
aimed at 386BSD. If you are interested in these packages running
on other platforms than 386BSD, you should contact the packages
maintainers. [Note to new package porters: please include mail
addresses, names and phone numbers for this purpose]. As a result,
to save space we may omit parts not relevant to 386BSD. Otherwise,
we'd get to gigabyte size in no time at all, and lose the point of
being a 386BSD clearing house.

If you find a bug or make an improvement, please inform the
maintainers and us of it. We reccomend sending new contributions
via the U.S. Mail on a floppy or tape to us at 447 61ST Street,
Oakland, CA 94609. Likewise with any new contributions, which
*should* be posted to the network news at the same time. Please
realize we have limited resources with our project, and it may take
a while before we can respond to your contribution.

If you have a great interest in maintaining a certain package on
386BSD that is important to you, please also contact us. We'll put
you in contact with those involved, and gratefully allow your
particapation with us on those packages.
