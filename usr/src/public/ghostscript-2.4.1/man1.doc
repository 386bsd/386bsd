Subject: Here is a unix manual page for gs 2.3

I was installing gs version 2.3 when I noticed, that there was only the
very minimal manual page for it. So, I wound up hacking one from the
file use.doc by reorganizing, adding formatting and some bits and pieces
of my own. I thought you might find use to it, so I'm sending it here to
you. Below is the troff source and after that is a pre-fomatted version,
in case you don't have access to troff and want to see what the file
looks like. The files are separated with cut lines and total about 14K,
so I think this should get to you without truncation.

.SH NAME
gs \- ghostscript previewer, version 2.3.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gs
[
.B \-D
.Iname
.B \-S
.I name
.B \-q
.B \-g
.I number1
x
.I number2
.B \-I
.I directories
.B \-h \- \-\-
.I prog args...
]
[
.I file
]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
Ghostscript is a programming language similar to Adobe Systems'
PostScript (tm) language, which is in turn similar to Forth.
.B Gs
reads
.I file
and displays or prints it as a Ghostscript file to an output device.

To invoke the interpreter, give the command
.B gs
.I filename1 ... filenameN.
The interpreter will read in the files in sequence and execute them.
After doing this, it reads further input from the primary input stream
(normally the keyboard). Each line (i.e. characters up to a
.B <return>
) is interpreted separately. To exit from the interpreter, type
.B quit<return>.
The interpreter also exits gracefully if it encounters end-of-file.
Typing the interrupt character, e.g.,
.B control-C,
is also safe.

.SH OPTIONS
The interpreter recognizes several options described below, which may
appear anywhere in the command line and apply to all files thereafter.
.TP
.B \-\-
.I filename arg1 ...
Takes the next argument as a file name as usual, but takes all remaining
arguments (even if they have the syntactic form of switches) and defines
the name
.B ARGUMENTS
in
.B userdict
(not
.B systemdict
) as an array of those strings,
.I before
running the file. When
.B gs
finishes executing the file, it exits back to the shell.
.TP
.B \-Dname\=token
.TP
.B \-dname\=token
Define a name in
.B systemdict
with the given definition. The token must be exactly one token (as
defined by the
.B token
operator) and must not contain any whitespace.
.TP
.B \-Dname
.TP
.B \-dname
Define a name in
.B systemdict
with value null.
.TP
.B \-Sname=string
.TP
.B \-sname=string
Define a name in
.B systemdict
with a given string as value. This is different from
.B \-D.
For example,
.B \-Dname=35
is equivalent to the program fragment
.B /name 35 def
whereas
.B \-Sname=35
is equivalent to
.B /name (35) def.

Note that
.B gs_init.ps
makes
.B systemdict
read-only, so the values of names defined with
.B \-D
or
.B \-S
cannot be changed (although, of course, they can be superseded by
definitions in
.B userdict
or other dictionaries).

Ghostscript may be built with multiple output devices (you can see the
list of supported devices by giving the command
.B gs \-h
). Ghostscript normally opens the first one and directs output to it.
To use device
.I xyz
as the initial output device, include the option
.B \-sDEVICE\=
.I xyz
in the command line.  Note that this switch must precede the first .ps
file, and only its first invocation has any effect.

Including
.B \-dNODISPLAY
in the command line will suppress the normal initialization of the
output device. This may be useful when debugging. Similarly,
.B \-dNOCACHE
disables character caching, and
.B \-dNOBIND
disables the 'bind' operator.
.B \-dNOPAUSE
disables the prompt and pause at the end of each page; this may be
desirable for applications where another program is 'driving'
.B gs.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet startup \- suppress normal startup messages, and also do the
equivalent of
.B \-dQUIET.
.TP
.B \-g
.I number1
x
.I number2
Equivalent to
.B \-dDEVICEWIDTH\=
.I number1
and
.B \-dDEVICEHEIGHT\=
.I number2.
This is for the benefit of devices (such as display windows) that
require (or allow) width and height to be specified.
.TP
.B \-I
.Idirectories
Adds the designated list of
.I directories
at the head of the search path for library files. This path is used to
locate the initialization and font files, and also files given to the
.B run
operator.
.B gs
searches these files using the specified
.B \-I
options, the contents of the environment variable
.B GS_LIB
and some site specific default values.

To work properly
.B gs
needs to have access to the initialization files
.B
gs_init.ps, gs_statd.ps, gs_fonts.ps
and various font files (these usually have extension .gsf or .pfa). The
program is usually configured so that it finds these files
automatically. You can use the
.B \-I
option if you want to add your own fonts or override the system
initialization files.
.TP
.B \-h
Prints a short usage message listing the available command line options
and supported output devices.
.TP
.B \-
This is not really a switch.  It indicates to
.B gs
that the standard input is coming from a file or a pipe.
.B gs
reads from stdin until reaching end-of-file, executing it like any other
file, and then continues processing the command line.  At the end of the
command line,
.B gs
exits rather than going into its interactive mode.
.SH X WINDOW SYSTEM RESOURCES
.B gs
looks for the following resources under the program name
.B Ghostscript:
.TP
.B borderWidth
the border width in pixels (default = 1)
.TP
.B borderColor
the name of the border color (default = black)
.TP
.B geometry
the window size and placement, WxH+X+Y
.TP
.B xResolution
the number of x pixels per inch (default is computed from
.B WidthOfScreen
and
.B WidthMMOfScreen
)
.TP
.B yResolution
the number of y pixels per inch (default is computed from
.B HeightOfScreen
and
.B HeightMMOfScreen
)
.SH EXAMPLES
To change output to printer in a normal configuration that includes an
PaintJet printer driver, you might use the shell command
.B gs \-sDEVICE\=paintjet myfile.ps
instead of just
.B gs myfile.ps
Alternatively, you can type

.B (paintjet) selectdevice

.B (myfile.ps) run.

All output then goes to the printer instead of the display until further
notice.  You can switch devices at any time by using the selectdevice
procedure, e.g.,
.B (x11) selectdevice
or
.B (paintjet) selectdevice

To find out what devices are available, just type
.B devicenames.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B gs_fonts.ps
Font initialization.
.TP
.B gs_init.ps
Various initialization routines.
.TP
.B gs_statd.ps
Dummy
.B statusdict
definitions for the benefit of PostScript files that think they are
being printed on a hardcopy printer.
.TP
.B Fontmap
A catalog of fonts known to
.B gs.
Lists the GhostScript name, corresponding font file name, font encoding
and font identification number for each font that
.B gs
knows.

GS(1)                    USER COMMANDS                      GS(1)



NAME
     gs - ghostscript previewer, version 2.3.

SYNOPSIS
     gs [ -D -S _n_a_m_e -q -g _n_u_m_b_e_r_1 x _n_u_m_b_e_r_2 -I _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_i_e_s -h  -
     -- _p_r_o_g _a_r_g_s... ] [ _f_i_l_e ]...


DESCRIPTION
     Ghostscript is a programming language similar to Adobe  Sys-
     tems'  PostScript (tm) language, which is in turn similar to
     Forth.  Gs reads  _f_i_l_e  and  displays  or  prints  it  as  a
     Ghostscript file to an output device.

     To invoke the interpreter, give the command gs _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_1 ...
     _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_N.  The  interpreter  will  read  in  the  files  in
     sequence and execute  them.   After  doing  this,  it  reads
     further  input  from  the primary input stream (normally the
     keyboard). Each line (i.e. characters up to a <return> )  is
     interpreted  separately.  To exit from the interpreter, type
     quit<return>. The interpreter also exits  gracefully  if  it
     encounters  end-of-file.   Typing  the  interrupt character,
     e.g., control-C, is also safe.


OPTIONS
     The interpreter recognizes several options described  below,
     which  may  appear anywhere in the command line and apply to
     all files thereafter.

     --   _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _a_r_g_1 ... Takes the next  argument  as  a  file
          name  as usual, but takes all remaining arguments (even
          if they  have  the  syntactic  form  of  switches)  and
          defines  the name ARGUMENTS in userdict (not systemdict
          ) as an array of  those  strings,  _b_e_f_o_r_e  running  the
          file.  When  gs  finishes  executing the file, it exits
          back to the shell.

     -Dname=token

     -dname=token
          Define a name in systemdict with the given  definition.
          The  token must be exactly one token (as defined by the
          token operator) and must not contain any whitespace.

     -Dname

     -dname
          Define a name in systemdict with value null.

     -Sname=string

GS(1)                    USER COMMANDS                      GS(1)



     -sname=string
          Define a name in systemdict  with  a  given  string  as
          value.   This   is  different  from  -D.  For  example,
          -Dname=35 is equivalent to the program  fragment  /name
          35  def  whereas  -Sname=35 is equivalent to /name (35)
          def.

          Note that gs_init.ps makes systemdict read-only, so the
          values of names defined with -D or -S cannot be changed
          (although, of course, they can be superseded by defini-
          tions in userdict or other dictionaries).

          Ghostscript may be built with multiple  output  devices
          (you  can  see  the list of supported devices by giving
          the command gs -h ).  Ghostscript  normally  opens  the
          first  one and directs output to it.  To use device _x_y_z
          as the initial output device, include the option -sDEV-
          ICE=  _x_y_z  in  the command line.  Note that this switch
          must precede the first .ps file,  and  only  its  first
          invocation has any effect.

          Including -dNODISPLAY in the command line will suppress
          the  normal  initialization  of the output device. This
          may be useful when debugging. Similarly, -dNOCACHE dis-
          ables  character  caching,  and  -dNOBIND  disables the
          'bind' operator.  -dNOPAUSE  disables  the  prompt  and
          pause  at  the  end of each page; this may be desirable
          for applications where another program is 'driving' gs.

     -q   Quiet startup - suppress normal startup  messages,  and
          also do the equivalent of -dQUIET.

     -g   _n_u_m_b_e_r_1 x _n_u_m_b_e_r_2 Equivalent to -dDEVICEWIDTH=  _n_u_m_b_e_r_1
          and -dDEVICEHEIGHT= _n_u_m_b_e_r_2. This is for the benefit of
          devices (such as  display  windows)  that  require  (or
          allow) width and height to be specified.

     -I   Adds the designated list of _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_i_e_s at the head  of
          the search path for library files. This path is used to
          locate the initialization  and  font  files,  and  also
          files  given  to  the  run operator.  gs searches these
          files using the specified -I options, the  contents  of
          the  environment variable GS_LIB and some site specific
          default values.

          To work properly gs needs to have access  to  the  ini-
          tialization  files gs_init.ps, gs_statd.ps, gs_fonts.ps
          and various font files (these  usually  have  extension
          .gsf  or  .pfa).  The  program is usually configured so
          that it finds these files automatically.  You  can  use
          the  -I  option  if  you  want to add your own fonts or
          override the system initialization files.
