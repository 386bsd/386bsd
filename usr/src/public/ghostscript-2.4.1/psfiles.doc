This file, psfiles.doc, describes the .ps files distributed with
Ghostscript, other than fonts.

For an overview of Ghostscript and a list of the documentation files, see
README.

System files
------------

gs_init.ps - Ghostscript reads this automatically when it starts up.  It
contains definitions of many standard procedures and initialization for a
wide variety of things.

gs_fonts.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in.  It initializes Ghostscript's font
machinery and provides some utility procedures that work with fonts.

gs_statd.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in.  It creates a dummy statusdict and
some other environmental odds and ends for the benefit of P*stScr*pt files
that really want to be printed on a LaserWriter.

gs_2asc.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in if the ASCIIOUT option is selected.
It redefines many operators.  For more information, see the comments in
the file.

gs_dps1.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in if the dps feature is included in
the configuration.  It provides support for various Display PostScript and
Level 2 features.

sym__enc.ps - the Symbol encoding, loaded only if referenced.

---

chess.ps - A black-and-white chessboard.

golfer.ps - A gray-scale picture of a stylishly dressed woman swinging a
golf club.

escher.ps - A colored version of a hexagonally symmetric Escher drawing of
interlocking butterflies.  Can be printed on monochrome devices, with
somewhat less dramatic results.
