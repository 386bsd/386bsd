There is a bug in the halftone screen logic in Ghostscript 2.4.1 (and
2.4 also) that may cause it to fail under some conditions for
high-resolution printers.  To fix this, change lines 234-235 of
gxht.c from

        if ( num_cached == size && num_cached <= max_cached_tiles / 2 )
           {    /* We can afford to replicate every tile vertically, */

to

        if ( num_cached == size &&
             tile_bytes * num_cached <= max_ht_bits / 2
           )
           {    /* We can afford to replicate every tile vertically, */

Please let me know if this fixes (or doesn't fix) the problem.
