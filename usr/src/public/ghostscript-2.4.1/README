******** An overview of Ghostscript ********
********

Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:

	- An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very
closely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and

	- A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that
implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive
operations in the Ghostscript language.

The Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely
in C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms.
Currently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform
families:

	- IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible
	  graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0;

	- A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11,
	  release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i,
	  Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix;
	  H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX
	  running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2;
	  Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo;

	- Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView;

	- VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler
	  version 3.1 or later is required).

It is very likely that Ghostscript will run under other versions of
MS-DOS, and other versions of Unix that support X11, but it has not
been tested in these environments.  Ghostscript does NOT run well on
PC-compatibles with Hercules display cards: text and graphics output
interfere with each other.

Ghostscript has also been ported to the Apple Macintosh and to the
Acorn Archimedes.  For information on the Macintosh port, contact
Martin Fong (fong@erg.sri.com).  For information on the Archimedes
port, contact David Elworthy (David.Elworthy@cl.cam.ac.uk).

******** Documentation overview ********
********

All the file names mentioned in the documentation, except for README,
are in lower case, which is the usual convention for Unix systems.
On MS-DOS systems, all file names are actually upper-case.

Files of interest to most users (both previous and new)
-------------------------------------------------------

> README - this file.

> readme.doc - information about problems and new features in the
current release.

If you have used a previous release of Ghostscript, you should also
read any more recent sections of history.doc.

Files of particular interest to new users
-----------------------------------------

> fonts.doc - information about the fonts distributed with Ghostscript.

> language.doc - A description of the Ghostscript language.

> make.doc - how to install, compile and link Ghostscript.

> psfiles.doc - information about the .ps files distributed with
Ghostscript (other than fonts).

> use.doc - information about to use Ghostscript.

Files of interest to fewer users
--------------------------------

> drivers.doc - the interface between Ghostscript and device drivers.

> hershey.doc - information about the Hershey fonts, which are the
basis of some of the Ghostscript fonts.

> history.doc - history of changes in Ghostscript releases.

******** Trouble reporting ********
********

If you have problems with Ghostscript, and you have access to Usenet
news, we suggest you post your question to gnu.ghostscript.bug.
There are hundreds of Ghostscript user sites all over the world, and
often another user will be able to help you.

If you wish to contact Aladdin Enterprises directly, you may reach us
at:

	Aladdin Enterprises
	P.O. box 60264
	Palo Alto, CA 94306
	(415)322-0103
	...{uunet,decwrl}!aladdin!ghost
	ghost@aladdin.com

If you call on the phone, you will usually be talking to an answering
machine.  In this case, please leave a message with your name and
phone number and the best time for us to return the call.

Because Ghostscript is distributed so widely, Aladdin Enterprises
doesn't have the resources to respond to everyone by e-mail.  We only
promise to respond to e-mail from the following classes of users:

	- Beta testers who have actually given us at least one report on
	some beta version supplied to them.

	- People developing drivers that are for, or applications that
	are based on, Ghostscript and that will be made freely available.

	- People who express serious interest in commercial licensing
	of Ghostscript.

	- Commercial licensees.

We also appreciate and welcome detailed, well-documented bug reports
from anyone, especially if they include a fix.

We do read gnu.ghostscript.bug and respond to significant problems
reported there, as time permits.

If you report a problem by e-mail, please specify which version of
Ghostscript you are running, and the hardware, operating system,
window system, and C compiler you are using, and be as specific as
you can about the problem -- this will help us a lot in tracking it
down.  We want Ghostscript to be a high-quality product, and will do
our best to fix any reported problem.

Given the choice between the Internet and the UUCP address, remember
that the Internet is not to be used for general commercial traffic:
if you aren't sure whether you or your organization can use the
Internet, use UUCP.

Aladdin Enterprises owns or has access to the following hardware and
software:

	80486 PC, MS-DOS 5.0, Borland C++ 3.0 (and several older versions);
	  color SuperVGA display; Epson-compatible printer
	  (the printer also is compatible with the IBM Proprinter);
	  various H-P printers; Canon BubbleJet.

	SPARCstation, SunOS 4.0, cc and gcc, X11R5 and SunView;
	  both monochrome and color displays.

	DECstation, Ultrix.

If your problem turns out to be specific to some other hardware or
software configuration, it may take longer to track down, since we
will have to rely on other users to help.

******** Things you can do to help ********
********

There are some projects that users could do that are somewhat
decoupled from the main body of the code, and that would help improve
Ghostscript:

	- Ghostscript needs some good, free, Type 1 (outline) fonts.
Karl Berry is working on this, but it might go faster if he got some
knowledgeable assistance.  Contact karl@cs.umb.edu if you want to
help with this.

	- Several people have asked for a program that will take
PostScript code and reconstruct some reasonable ASCII form of the
input, if this is possible.  Ghostscript's -dASCIIOUT switch does a
fair job of extracting the strings and their placement on the page,
but that's only the easy half of the job: a second pass is needed to
figure out, at a minimum, where paragraph breaks are (based on Y
positioning), and where spaces go (based on X positioning).  Contact
ghost@aladdin.com if you want to help by doing this.

	- Adobe has donated the specification of the Display
PostScript C API to the X distribution.  Implementing this API for
Ghostscript might make Ghostscript a lot more useful, since it would
then be "plug compatible" with Display PostScript in an important
way.  This might not be a very big project.  Contact
ghost@aladdin.com if you would like to help with this.

	- On gray-scale displays, it might be worthwhile implementing
anti-aliased fonts.  To do this, one would modify the renderer so
that it cached a high-resolution bitmap, and then did the
anti-aliasing as it copied the bitmap to the device.  This would
allow simulating fractional-pixel positioning, which is one of the
great benefits of anti-aliased fonts.  Contact ghost@aladdin.com if
this is of interest to you.

Another thing we need a volunteer to help with is maintaining the
SunView driver.  Since nearly all SunView sites have switched to
OpenWindows or plain X Windows, we (Aladdin Enterprises) plan to stop
updating it sometime fairly soon.  Please contact ghost@aladdin.com
if you are willing to help with this.
