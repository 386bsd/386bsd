     SShhaarr writes an sh(1) shell script to the standard output which will
     recreate the file hierarchy specified by the command line operands.
     Directories will be recreated and must be specified before the files they
     contain.

     SShhaarr is normally used for distributing small numbers of files by ftp(1)
     or mail(1).

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     compress(1),  mail(1),  uuencode(1),  tar(1)

BBUUGGSS
     SShhaarr makes no provisions for special types of files or files containing
     magic characters.

     It is easy to insert trojan horses into sshhaarr files.  It is strongly
     recommended that all shell archive files be examined before running them
     through sh(1).  Archives produced using this implementation of sshhaarr may
     be easily examined with the command:

           grep -v '^X' program.shar

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     To create a shell archive of the program ls(1) and mail it to Rick:

           cd ls
           shar `find . -print`  mail -s "ls source" rick

     To recreate the program directory:

           mkdir ls
           cd ls
           <delete header lines and examine mailed archive>
           sh archive
