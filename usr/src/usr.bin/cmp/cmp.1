.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cmp
.Nd Compare two files.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cmp
.Op Fl l Li \&| Fl s
.Ar file1 file2
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The cmp utility compares two files of any type and
writes the results to the standard output.
By default,
.Nm
is silent if the files are the same; if they differ, the byte
and line number at which the first difference occurred is reported.
.Pp
Bytes and lines are numbered beginning with one.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
Print the byte number (decimal) and the differing
byte values (octal) for each difference.
.It Fl s
Print nothing for differing files; return exit
status only.
.El
.Pp
If
.Ar file1
or
.Ar file2
is ``-'', the the standard input is used.
.Pp
The
.Nm cmp
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It 0
The files are identical.
.It 1
The files are different; this includes the case
where one file is identical to the first part of
the other.
In the latter case, if the
.Fl s
option has
not been specified, cmp writes to standard error
that EOF was reached in the shorter file (before
any differences were found).
.It >1
An error occurred.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr diff 1 ,
.Xr diff3 1
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm cmp
function is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.
