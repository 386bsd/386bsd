/* Relinquish privileges temporarily for a setuid program
 * with the option of getting them back later.  This is done by swapping
 * the real and effective userid BSD style.  Call RELINQUISH_PRIVS once
 * at the beginning of the main program.  This will cause all operatons
 * to be executed with the real userid.  When you need the privileges
 * of the setuid invocation, call PRIV_START; when you no longer
 * need it, call PRIV_END.  Note that it is an error to call PRIV_START
 * and not PRIV_END within the same function.
 *
 * Use RELINQUISH_PRIVS_ROOT(a) if your program started out running
 * as root, and you want to drop back the effective userid to a
 * and the effective group id to b, with the option to get them back
 * later.
 *
 * If you no longer need root privileges, but those of some other
 * userid, you can call REDUCE_PRIV(a) when your effective
 * is the user's.
 *
 * Problems: Do not use return between PRIV_START and PRIV_END; this
 * will cause the program to continue running in an unprivileged
 * state.
 *
 * It is NOT safe to call exec(), system() or popen() with a user-
 * supplied program (i.e. without carefully checking PATH and any
 * library load paths) with relinquished privileges; the called program
 * can aquire them just as easily.  Set both effective and real userid
 * to the real userid before calling any of them.
