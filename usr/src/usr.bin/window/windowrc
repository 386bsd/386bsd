# Create two unequal sized windows of full screen width,

# terse on			# set terse mode
# escape "^A"			# set escape character
# nline 100			# set default buffer size
				# initially, this is 48

# Make two windows
# The bottom one is MIN(24, total lines * 3 / 4) lines
# The top one is the rest of the screen.
