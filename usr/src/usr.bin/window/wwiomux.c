 * Multiple window output handler.
 * The idea is to copy window outputs to the terminal, via the
 * display package.  We try to give wwcurwin highest priority.
 * The only return conditions are when there is keyboard input
 * and when a child process dies, which are serviced by signal
 * catchers (wwrint() and wwchild()).
 * When there's nothing to do, we sleep in a select().
 * This can be done better with interrupt driven io.  But that's
 * not supported on ptys, yet.
 * The history of this routine is interesting.
