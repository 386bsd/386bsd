RCS release 3 is still available for free, if you retrieve it yourself over
the UUCP or ARPA net.  If you need a tape, there is a handlig charge of
$100.  In both cases, we need a signed copy of the non-disclosure form
below, executed by the person who handles your Unix licenses.  Upon receipt
of the completed form, we will send you detailed instructions on how to
retrieve RCS.  If you also include the handling charge, we will mail a tape
with RCS instead.

The whole package consists of RCS proper, the manual pages for it, and
modified versions of the Unix commands diff and diff3.  If you need more
information on RCS before getting it, read "Design, Implementation, and
Evaluation of a Revision Control System", by Walter Tichy, in Proc. of the
6th Int'l Conference on Software Engineering, Sept. 1982, IEEE.
