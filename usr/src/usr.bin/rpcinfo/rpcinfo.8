.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm rpcinfo
makes an
.Tn RPC
call to an
.Tn RPC
server and reports what it finds.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl p
Probe the portmapper on
.Ar host ,
and print a list of all registered
.Tn RPC
programs.  If
.Ar host
is not specified, it defaults to the value returned by
.Xr hostname 1 .
.It Fl u
Make an
.Tn RPC
call to procedure 0 of
.Ar program
on the specified
.Ar host
using
.Tn UDP ,
and report whether a response was received.
.It Fl t
Make an
.Tn RPC
call to procedure 0 of
.Ar program
on the specified
.Ar host
using
.Tn TCP ,
and report whether a response was received.
.It Fl n
Use
.Ar portnum
as the port number for the
.Fl t
and
.Fl u
options instead of the port number given by the portmapper.
.It Fl b
Make an
.Tn RPC
broadcast to procedure 0 of the specified
.Ar program
and
.Ar version
using
.Tn UDP
and report all hosts that respond.
.It Fl d
Delete registration for the
.Tn RPC
service of the specified
.Ar program
and
.Ar version .
This option can be exercised only by the super-user.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar program
argument can be either a name or a number.
.Pp
If a
.Ar version
is specified,
.Nm rpcinfo
attempts to call that version of the specified
.Ar program .
Otherwise,
.Nm rpcinfo
attempts to find all the registered version
numbers for the specified
.Ar program
by calling version 0 (which is presumed not
to exist; if it does exist,
.Ar rpcinfo
attempts to obtain this information by calling
an extremely high version
number instead) and attempts to call each registered version.
Note: the version number is required for
.Fl b
and
.Fl d
options.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To show all of the
.Tn RPC
services registered on the local machine use:
.Pp
.Dl example% rpcinfo -p
.Pp
To show all of the
.Tn RPC
services registered on the machine named
.Ar klaxon
use:
.Pp
.Dl example% rpcinfo -p klaxon
.Pp
To show all machines on the local net that are running the Yellow Pages
service use:
.Pp
.Dl example% rpcinfo -b ypserv 'version' | uniq
.Pp
where 'version' is the current Yellow Pages version obtained from the
results of the
.Fl p
switch above.
.Pp
To delete the registration for version 1 of the
.Nm walld
service use:
.Pp
.Dl example% rpcinfo -d walld 1

.Sh BUGS
In releases prior to SunOS 3.0, the Network File System (NFS) did not
register itself with the portmapper;
.Nm rpcinfo
cannot be used to make
.Tn RPC
calls to the
.Tn NFS
server on hosts running such releases.
