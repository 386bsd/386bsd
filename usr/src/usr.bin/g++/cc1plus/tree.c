/* This file contains the low level primitives for operating on tree nodes,
   including allocation, list operations, interning of identifiers,
   construction of data type nodes and statement nodes,
   and construction of type conversion nodes.  It also contains
   tables index by tree code that describe how to take apart
   nodes of that code.

   It is intended to be language-independent, but occasionally
   calls language-dependent routines defined (for C) in typecheck.c.

   The low-level allocation routines oballoc and permalloc
   are used also for allocating many other kinds of objects

/* Return OP, stripped of any conversions to wider types as much as is safe.
   Converting the value back to OP's type makes a value equivalent to OP.

   If FOR_TYPE is nonzero, we return a value which, if converted to
   type FOR_TYPE, would be equivalent to converting OP to type FOR_TYPE.

   If FOR_TYPE is nonzero, unaligned bit-field references may be changed to the
   narrowest type that can hold the value, even if they don't exactly fit.
   Otherwise, bit-field references are changed to a narrower type
   only if they can be fetched directly from memory in that type.

   OP must have integer, real or enumeral type.  Pointers are not allowed!

   There are some cases where the obvious value we could return
   would regenerate to OP if converted to OP's type, 
   but would not extend like OP to wider types.
   If FOR_TYPE indicates such extension is contemplated, we eschew such values.
   For example, if OP is (unsigned short)(signed char)-1,
   we avoid returning (signed char)-1 if FOR_TYPE is int,
   even though extending that to an unsigned short would regenerate OP,
   since the result of extending (signed char)-1 to (int)
