	clean_up_expression().  Detect foo: bar: ... foo-bar...

Tue Dec  4 16:29:20 EST 1990	Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* m68k.c  Fixed an obscure bug involving AOFF mode with a

	* i860.c i860-opcode.h  Added patches from rgb@mcc.com

	* m68k.c reverse the sense of -l option, and allow :w and :l to
	override the default size of AOFF indexes.

	Also, allow -l to shorten branches to unknown labels from LONG to WORD.

	difference of two symbols which are in different frags.  (We can't
	find out how far apart they are.)

Wed Aug 15 12:18:58 EDT 1990	Jay Fenlason

	* m68k.c (m68k_ip_op)  Dyke out the code that deals with parsing
	:[wl] at the end of expressions since it is handled in get_num()
	and this was putting the result in the wrong place anyway.

Mon Aug 13 15:53:46 EDT 1990	Jay Fenlason

	* read.c  Handle .align specially on the sparc, or any other machine

	* m68k.c Added a hack so that fsincosx fpx,fpy:fpz works.

	* messages.c New function: as_bad  This is like as_warn, except

	(adelman@tgv.com) for c++?  (A dozen lines or so)

	* version.c: Moved all comments about changes to ChangeLog (this file).
	Many anonymous entries have been attributed to Jay Fenlason (hack).

Thu Aug 17 15:53:57 1989  Jay Fenlason  (hack at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* atof-generic.c (atof_generic): Accept any case for
	inf and nan.

	* m68k.c (m68_ip): Don't use PC-relative mode for alterable
	addressing modes.

Tue Aug 15 04:58:36 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* sparc.c (md_begin): Rewrote this function to perform consistency
	checks with the new opcode table.

Fri Aug 11 16:01:16 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

Thu Aug  3 14:44:24 1989  Jay Fenlason  (hack at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile (a32k): Use read- and write-ns32k.o
	* ns32k.c (encode_operand): Make sure pcrel_adjust starts out zeroed.
	* read.c (cons): Call fix_new_ns32k() if NS32K is defined.
	* write.c (write_object_file): Ditto.
	These so that .word sym-sym (etc) will produce values with
	the proper byte-order.

Wed Aug 2 12:55:?? 1989  Jay Fenlason (hack at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* sparc.c (comment_chars[]): Removed '|' because it was causing
	problems.  Probably not the best fix, since I suspect other
	assemblers (68020) may get | in .stabs also, and the 68020 needs
	the '|' comment character.

	  imull foo,%eax no longer gets assembled into the 32-64 bit
	  multiply, which clobbers %edx behind gcc's back

	  jcxz/jecxz were backwards

	  There was a bug when using %ebp as a base register with no
	  displacement

	  Instructions like andb $0xffffff, %al used to put out too many
	  immediate bytes

	  The splitting jump instructions across frags could happen when
	  obstack_room()==6 too.
