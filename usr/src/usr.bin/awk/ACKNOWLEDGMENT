Carl Mascott ported mawk to V7 and in the process rooted out
some subtle (and not so subtle) bugs.

Ian Searle ported mawk to System V and put up with my insane
attempts to get fpe exception trapping off.

An anonymous reviewer for comp.sources.reviewed did the
MSC and Mac ports and wrote .bat files for the tests.
Another or maybe the same reviewer did the Dynix port.

Ports to new systems:
	Layne Lommen		ApolloSR10.3
	Ed Ferguson		MIPS M2000 C2.20 OS4.52
	Jwahar R. Bammi		Atari ST
	Berry Kercheval		SGI IRIX 4.0.1
	Andy Mason		Next 2.1
	Mike Carlton		Next 2.1
	Elliot Jaffe		AIX 3.1

The DOS version is a lot better thanks to suggestions and testing
from Ed Ferguson, Jack Fitts, Nadav Horesh, Michael Golan and
Conny Ohstrom.

Arnold Robbins kept me current on POSIX standards for AWK, and
explained some of the "dark corners".
