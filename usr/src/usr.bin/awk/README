This is mawk 1.1

Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK programming language.

Mawk 1.0 implemented the language as defined in the 1988 AWK book.
Version 1.1 adds new features:

     -- Full posix1003.2 draft(11.2) compliance
	
	toupper(), tolower(), CONVFMT and ENVIRON[]

	-v var=value command line assignments

	Ansi C compatible printf() and sprintf()

     -- Hard coded limits are either removed or much larger

     -- MsDOS added, system() and pipes.  BINMODE variable to
	control CRLF translation.
