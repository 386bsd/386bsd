This is an automated report from the backup script running on 
`hostname`. 

Volume ${volno} of the backup needs to be put in the tape drive.  Usually
whoever prepared the backup leaves labeled tapes on top of the drive
itself.  If there aren't any more, information about where to find tapes
and how to label them are posted on the wall by apple-gunkies (unhelpfully
obscured by a bookshelf).  An online copy (which is probably more
up-to-date) can also be found in ~friedman/etc/fsf/backup.how.
