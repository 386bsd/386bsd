This GNU tar 1.10.  Please send bug reports, etc., to
bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.  

This is GNU tar.  It is based heavily on John Gilmore's public domain
tar, but with added features.  The manual is currently being written.
An old manual, surely riddled with errors, is in tar.texinfo.  Please
don't send in bug reports about that manual.  In particular, the
mechanism for doing incremental dumps has been significantly changed.

The mt program is in the GNU cpio distribution.

Various people have been having problems using floppies on a NeXT.
I've gotten conflicting reports about what should be done to solve the
problems, and we have no way to test it ourselves.  If you don't have
"rename" in your C library, you will need to find an implementation.
I'm not sure if I want to roll in the GNU implementation into tar.

User-visible changes since 1.09:

Filename to -G is optional.  -C works right.  
Names +newer and +newer-mtime work right.

-g is now +incremental
-G is now +listed-incremental

Sparse files now work correctly.

+volume is now called +label.

+exclude now takes a filename argument, and +exclude-from does what
+exclude used to do.

Exit status is now correct.

+totals keeps track of total I/O and prints it when tar exits.

When using +label with +extract, the label is now a regexp.

New option +tape-length (-L) does multi-volume handling like BSD dump:
you tell tar how big the tape is and it will prompt at that point
instead of waiting for a write error.

New backup scripts level-0 and level-1 which might be useful to
people.  They use a file "backup-specs" for information, and shouldn't
need local modification.  These are what we use to do all our backups
at the FSF.
