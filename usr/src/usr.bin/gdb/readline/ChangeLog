	* Makefile (the *other* libreadline.a): Uncomment out ranlib line.

Thu Feb  1 17:50:22 1990  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at pogo.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile (libreadline.a): Uncomment out ranlib line.

Sun Nov 26 16:29:11 1989  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* readline.c (rl_deprep_terminal): Only restore local_mode_flags
	if they had been set.

Thu Oct 19 17:18:40 1989  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* Move vi_doing_insert from vi_mode.c to readline.c

	* readline.c: Move compare_strings before its use.
	Remove declarations.

	* readline.c: Move defining_kbd_macro above rl_dispatch.
	(rl_dispatch): Remove "extern int defining_kbd_macro".

Mon Oct 16 11:56:03 1989  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* readline.c (rl_set_signals): Remove unnecessary "static int
	rl_signal_handler()".

Sat Sep 30 14:51:56 1989  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* readline.c (rl_initialize): Change parsing_conditionalized_out
	to static.
	(rl_dispatch): Change defining_kbd_macro to static.
	(rl_newline): Change vi_doing_insert to static.

Fri Sep  8 09:00:45 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: rl_prep_terminal ().  Only turn on 8th bit
	  as meta-bit iff the terminal is not using parity.

Sun Sep  3 08:57:40 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: start_insert ().  Uses multiple
	  insertion call in cases where that makes sense.

	  rl_insert ().  Read type-ahead buffer for additional
	  keys that are bound to rl_insert, and insert them
	  all at once.  Make insertion of single keys given
	  with an argument much more efficient.

Tue Aug  8 18:13:57 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: Changed handling of EOF.  readline () returns
	 (char *)EOF or consed string.  The EOF character is read from the
	 tty, or if the tty doesn't have one, defaults to C-d.

	* readline.c: Added support for event driven programs.
	  rl_event_hook is the address of a function you want called
	  while Readline is waiting for input.

	* readline.c: Cleanup time.  Functions without type declarations
	  do not use return with a value.

	* history.c: history_expand () has new variable which is the
	  characters to ignore immediately following history_expansion_char.

Sun Jul 16 08:14:00 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* rl_prep_terminal ()
	  BSD version turns off C-s, C-q, C-y, C-v.

	* readline.c -- rl_prep_terminal ()
	  SYSV version hacks readline_echoing_p.
	  BSD version turns on passing of the 8th bit for the duration
	  of reading the line.

Tue Jul 11 06:25:01 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: new variable rl_tilde_expander.
	  If non-null, this contains the address of a function to call if
	  the standard meaning for expanding a tilde fails.  The function is
	  called with the text sans tilde (as in "foo"), and returns a
	  malloc()'ed string which is the expansion, or a NULL pointer if
	  there is no expansion. 

	* readline.h - new file chardefs.h
	  Separates things that only readline.c needs from the standard
	  header file publishing interesting things about readline.

	* readline.c:
	  readline_default_bindings () now looks at terminal chararacters
	  and binds those as well.

Wed Jun 28 20:20:51 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* Made readline and history into independent libraries.
