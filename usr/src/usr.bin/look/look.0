     llooookk - display lines beginning with a given string

     llooookk [--ddff] _s_t_r_i_n_g [_f_i_l_e]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The llooookk utility displays any lines in _f_i_l_e which contain _s_t_r_i_n_g as a
     prefix.  As llooookk performs a binary search, the lines in _f_i_l_e must be
     sorted.

     If _f_i_l_e is not specified, the file /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_d_i_c_t/_w_o_r_d_s is used, only
     alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of alphabetic
     characters is ignored.

     Options:

     --dd      Dictionary character set and order, i.e. only alphanumeric
             characters are compared.

     --ff      Ignore the case of alphabetic characters.

     The llooookk utility exits 0 if one or more lines were found and displayed, 1
     if no lines were found, and >1 if an error occurred.

     The original manual page stated that tabs and blank characters
     participated in comparisons when the --dd option was specified.  This was
     incorrect and the current man page matches the historic implementation.

     LLooookk appeared in Version 7 AT&T Unix.
