/* we need to do this because gas is really a bsd style assembler,

 *
 *  ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP is .set .,.+N, which isn't implemented in gas
 *  ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL is done with .set .,.+N, but that can't be
 *   used to define bss static space
 *
 * Next is the question of whether to uses underscores.  RMS didn't
 * like this idea at first, but since it is now obvious that we
 * need this separate tm file for use with gas, at least to get
 * dbx debugging info, I think we should also switch to underscores.
 * We can keep i386v for real att style output, and the few
 * people who want both form will have to compile twice.
