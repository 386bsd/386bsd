/* This file contains the low level primitives for operating on tree nodes,
   including allocation, list operations, interning of identifiers,
   construction of data type nodes and statement nodes,
   and construction of type conversion nodes.  It also contains
   tables index by tree code that describe how to take apart
   nodes of that code.

   It is intended to be language-independent, but occasionally
   calls language-dependent routines defined (for C) in typecheck.c.

   The low-level allocation routines oballoc and permalloc
