   For the operations handled here, such truncation distribution

   It is desirable in these cases:
   1) when truncating down to full-word from a larger size
   2) when truncating takes no work.
   3) when at least one operand of the arithmetic has been extended
   (as by C's default conversions).  In this case we need two conversions
   if we do the arithmetic as already requested, so we might as well
   truncate both and then combine.  Perhaps that way we need only one.

   Note that in general we cannot do the arithmetic in a type
   shorter than the desired result of conversion, even if the operands
   are both extended from a shorter type, because they might overflow
   if combined in that type.  The exceptions to this--the times when
   two narrow values can be combined in their narrow type even to
