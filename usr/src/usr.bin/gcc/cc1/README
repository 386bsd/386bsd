This directory contains the version 1.38 release of the GNU C compiler.
All bugs reported for previous test releases have been fixed.
This version probably does not have very many bugs, and we no longer
consider it a test version.

See the file gcc.texinfo for installation and porting information.
The file INSTALL contains a copy of the installation information.

The GNU C compiler is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying
permission.

The files print-self.c and print-self1.c are not part of GCC.
They are programs that print themselves on standard output.
They were written by Dario Dariol and Giovanni Cozzi, and are
included for your hacking pleasure.
