 *
 * Locate scans a file list for the full pathname of a file given only part
 * of the name.  The list has been processed with with "front-compression"
 * and bigram coding.  Front compression reduces space by a factor of 4-5,
 * bigram coding by a further 20-25%.
 *
 * The codes are:
 * 
 * 	0-28	likeliest differential counts + offset to make nonnegative
 *	30	switch code for out-of-range count to follow in next word
 *	128-255 bigram codes (128 most common, as determined by 'updatedb')
 *	32-127  single character (printable) ascii residue (ie, literal)
 * 
 * A novel two-tiered string search technique is employed:
 * 
 * First, a metacharacter-free subpattern and partial pathname is matched
 * BACKWARDS to avoid full expansion of the pathname list.  The time savings
 * is 40-50% over forward matching, which cannot efficiently handle
 * overlapped search patterns and compressed path residue.
 * 
 * Then, the actual shell glob-style regular expression (if in this form) is
 * matched against the candidate pathnames using the slower routines provided
 * in the standard 'find'.
