Differences between textstyle and displaystyle

superscripts are a little higher in displaystyle
(does not apply to cramped variants)

operators are bigger in ds
[not done automatically]

more separation between square-root bar and top of contents
in displaystyle

fractions are different: in textstyle change to script style;
also num and denom positions different; also minimum
separation between bar and contents different.

	D 	D'	T	T'	S	S'
sup	sup1	sup3	sup2	sup3	sup2	sup3
sroot	xh	xh	rt	rt	rt	rt
space	yes	yes	yes	yes	no	no

If we make text-style--->display-style,

too much separation square roots
