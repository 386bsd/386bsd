Here are some things that would be useful additions to groff:

  refer (I have nearly finished this)

  -mm macros

  a driver for the HP Laserjet 2 and 3

  grap

  a deroff that understands long names

  a page-makeup postprocessor and associated macro package
  (like pm and -mpm)

  a complete, self-contained manual

If you want to work on one of these, I suggest you contact me first.
