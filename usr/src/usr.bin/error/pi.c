/*
 *	Attempt to handle error messages produced by pi (and by pc)
 *
 *	problem #1:	There is no file name available when a file does not
 *			use a #include; this will have to be given to error
 *			in the command line.
 *	problem #2:	pi doesn't always tell you what line number
 *			a error refers to; for example during the tree
 *			walk phase of code generation and error detection,
 *			an error can refer to "variable foo in procedure bletch"
 *			without giving a line number
 *	problem #3:	line numbers, when available, are attached to
 *			the source line, along with the source line itself
 *			These line numbers must be extracted, and
 *			the source line thrown away.
 *	problem #4:	Some error messages produce more than one line number
 *			on the same message.
 *			There are only two (I think):
 *				%s undefined on line%s
 *				%s improperly used on line%s
 *			here, the %s makes line plural or singular.
 *
 *	Here are the error strings used in pi version 1.2 that can refer
 *	to a file name or line number:
 *
 *		Multiply defined label in case, lines %d and %d
 *		Goto %s from line %d is into a structured statement
 *		End matched %s on line %d
 *		Inserted keyword end matching %s on line %d
 *
 *	Here are the general pi patterns recognized:
 *	define piptr == -.*^-.*
 *	define msg = .*
 *	define digit = [0-9]
 *	definename = .*
 *	define date_format letter*3 letter*3 (digit | (digit digit)) 
 *			(digit | (digit digit)):digit*2 digit*4
 *
 *	{e,E} (piptr) (msg)	Encounter an error during textual scan
 *	E {digit}* - (msg)	Have an error message that refers to a new line
 *	E - msg			Have an error message that refers to current
 *					function, program or procedure
 *	(date_format) (name):	When switch compilation files
 *	... (msg)		When refer to the previous line
 *	'In' ('procedure'|'function'|'program') (name):
 *				pi is now complaining about 2nd pass errors.
 *	
 *	Here is the output from a compilation
 *
 *
 *	     2  	var	i:integer;
 *	e --------------^--- Inserted ';'
 *	E 2 - All variables must be declared in one var part
 *	E 5 - Include filename must end in .i
 *	Mon Apr 21 15:56 1980  test.h:
 *	     2  begin
 *	e ------^--- Inserted ';'
 *	Mon Apr 21 16:06 1980  test.p:
 *	E 2 - Function type must be specified
 *	     6  procedure foo(var x:real);
 *	e ------^--- Inserted ';'
 *	In function bletch:
 *	  E - No assignment to the function variable
 *	  w - variable x is never used
 *	E 6 - foo is already defined in this block
 *	In procedure foo:
 *	  w - variable x is neither used nor set
 *	     9  	z : = 23;
 *	E --------------^--- Undefined variable
 *	    10  	y = [1];
 *	e ----------------^--- Inserted ':'
 *	    13  	z := 345.;
 *	e -----------------------^--- Digits required after decimal point
 *	E 10 - Constant set involved in non set context
 *	E 11 - Type clash: real is incompatible with integer
 *	   ... Type of expression clashed with type of variable in assignment
 *	E 12 - Parameter type not identical to type of var parameter x of foo
 *	In program mung:
 *	  w - variable y is never used
 *	  w - type foo is never used
 *	  w - function bletch is never used
 *	  E - z undefined on lines 9 13
