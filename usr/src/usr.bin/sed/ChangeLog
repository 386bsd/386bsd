	* Version 1.08.

	* sed.c (compile_filename): If reading a file fails, read
	/dev/null instead.  It's what Unix and POSIX do, effectively.

	* sed.c (compile_regex): The 'slash' character doesn't
	terminate the regex if it's in a character class.

	* sed.c (main): If given no args, or bad option, print usage
	message.
	(usage): New function.

	* sed.c (execute_program): Amount written for 'P' command was
	wrong.  From stephend@ksr.com (Stephen Davis).

Wed Aug  7 16:51:14 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at apple-gunkies)

	* sed.c (append_pattern_space): Check for buffer full before
	instead of after writing to buffer.  Don't need to test for
	EOF initially anymore, due to the next change.
	(execute_program): For 'n' and 'N' commands, if eof is reached
	in input, quit the script like Unix sed does.
	Fix memory allocation problems for 'a' and 'r' commands.
	(compile_program): Fix off by one error in processing comments.
	All of the above are from Tapani Tarvainen, tarvaine@tukki.jyu.fi.

	* sed.c (setup_jump): Use isblank instead of testing for ' '
	or '\t', for POSIX locales.

	* utils.c (ck_strdup): Renamed from strdup.
	* sed.c: Change callers.

	* sed.c, utils.c: Clean up declarations and includes to get
	rid of compiler warnings.

	* sed.c (main): Add long-named options.  Don't complain if -n
	is given twice.

Fri Aug  2 12:33:16 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at apple-gunkies)

	* configure: Support +srcdir arg.  Create config.status and
	remove it and Makefile if interrupted while creating them.
	* Makefile.in: Change DESTDIR to prefix.

Mon Jul 15 13:07:39 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c (main): Add -V option to print version number.
	(USAGE): Mention -V.

Mon Jul  8 01:42:22 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c: Define bcopy in terms of memcpy if STDC_HEADERS as
	well as if USG.
	(compile_filename): Don't glob filename (for 'r' and 'w'
	commands).  Unix sed doesn't do it and it's not very useful,
	since it can only match 0 or 1 files.
	(execute_program): Change '\a' to 007 since some compilers
	don't recognize \a.
	* utils.c: New file; code moved from sed.c.
	* Replace Makefile with Makefile.in and configure.
	Update README.

Tue Mar 26 13:00:48 EST 1991	Jay Fenlason (hack@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c (match_address)  Added a trivial cast for portability.

Mon Feb 25 13:23:29 EST 1991	Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c  Changed 's' command to work with latest version of regex()
	routines, which mysteriously changed somewhere in there. . .
	A one-line patch from David Eckelkamp (eckelkamp@mcc.com).

	Initialize the fastmap in the hopes that it'll make sed faster.

Thu Feb 21 13:42:27 EST 1991	Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mti.edu)

	* sed.c Change panic to compile with other __STDC__ compilers.

Wed Jan 30 10:46:38 EST 1991	Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

Tue Nov 27 15:34:51 EST 1990	Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c (setup_jump)  Don't blow chunks if there isn't a label
	after a b or t command.

		(main) Don't panic if it a branch command doesn't have
	a label to branch to.

		(main)  Collect all the -e arguments together and parse them
	all at once.  This way, -e { -e mumble -e } will work.

	All these small patches from David Schmidt (davids@isc-br.isc-br.com)

Tue Sep 11 12:51:37 EDT 1990	Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c Changed some function forward declarations to use VOID *
	instead of char *

Mon Jul 16 11:12:54 EDT 1990 Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c (ck_malloc)  Use malloc(1) instead of malloc(0) if given
	a request for zero bytes.

	Reformat some comments to fit in 79 columns.
	Base whether to use void * on __STDC__, not __GNU__.
	(main): Add missing arg when printing usage message.
	Print usage if given invalid arg.
	(panic) [__STDC__]: Add missing ", ...".
	(compile_filename): Print correct error message if glob_filename
	returns NULL.

Thu Apr  5 21:41:12 1990  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at pogo.ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c (execute_program, case 'r'): When need to realloc append.text,
	multiply append.alloc by 2 instead of adding
	cur_cmd->x.cmd_txt.text_len.

Tue Mar  6 15:55:35 EST 1990 Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c (compile_regex)  Allocate 10 bytes extra space needed by
	re_compile_pattern.

Sun Feb 25 16:32:10 1990  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at pogo.ai.mit.edu)

	A two character patch from Robert A Bruce (rab@allspice.berkeley.edu)

Wed Sep 27 18:47:39 EDT 1989		hack@ai.mit.edu

	* sed.c (compile_regex)  New function.  When compiling regex,
	turn ^ into \` and $ into \' so that they won't match on embedded
	newlines.  UN*X	pattern matching is a crock.
	(compile_program, compile_address) call compile_regex.

Mon Sep 18 10:15:32 EDT 1989		hack@ai.mit.edu

	* sed.c (compile_program):  define translate as unsigned char * so
	that y command will work on non-ascii characters.

	Changed version number to 1.06.

Thu Sep 14 15:57:08 EDT 1989		hack@ai.mit.edu

	* sed.c  (compile_program)  Let programs use ; to terminate } as
	well as newline.

	(read_file) Print an error msg to stderr if it can't open an
 	input file.

Thu Mar 23 18:04:46 1989  Randall Smith  (randy at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile, sed.c: Added new copyright notice.

	* Makefile: Make distributions which follow the symlinks.
