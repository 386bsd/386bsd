.Sh NAME
.Nm stty
.Nd Set the options for a terminal device interface.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm stty
.Op Fl a | Fl e | Fl g
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op operands
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm stty
utility sets or reports on terminal
characteristics for the device that is its standard input.
If no options or operands are specified, it reports the settings of a set
of characteristics as well as additional ones if they differ from their
default values.
Otherwise it modifies
the terminal state according to the specified arguments.
Some combinations of arguments are mutually
exclusive on some terminal types.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard output 
in the
.St -p1003.2 .
.It Fl e
Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard output 
in the traditional
.Tn BSD
``all'' and ``everything'' formats.
.It Fl f
Display the current settings for the terminal named by
.Ar file .
.It Fl g
Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard output 
in a form that may be used as an argument to a subsequent invocation of
.Nm stty
to restore the current terminal state.
.El
.Pp
The following arguments are available to set the terminal
characteristics:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Cm parenb Pq Fl parenb
Enable (disable) parity generation
and detection.
.It Cm parodd Pq Fl parodd
Select odd (even) parity.
.It Cm cs5 cs6 cs7 cs8

.It Ar number
Set terminal baud rate to the
number given, if possible.
If the
baud rate is set to zero, modem
control is no longer
asserted.
.It Cm ispeed Ar number
Set terminal input baud rate to the
number given, if possible.
If the
input baud rate is set to zero, the
input baud rate is set to the
value of the output baud
rate.
.It Cm ospeed Ar number
Set terminal output baud rate to
the number given, if possible.
If
the output baud rate is set to
zero, modem control is
no longer asserted.
.It Cm hupcl Pq Fl hupcl
Stop asserting modem control
(do not stop asserting modem control) on last close.
.It Cm hup Pq Fl hup
Same as hupcl
.Pq Fl hupcl .
.It Cm cstopb Pq Fl cstopb
Use two (one) stop bits per character.
.It Cm cread Pq Fl cread
Enable (disable) the receiver.
.It Cm clocal Pq Fl clocal
Assume a line without (with) modem
control.
.It Cm ignbrk Pq Fl ignbrk
Ignore (do not ignore) break on
input.
.It Cm brkint Pq Fl brkint

on
break.

Ignore (do not ignore) parity
errors.
.It Cm parmrk Pq Fl parmrk
Mark (do not mark) parity errors.
.It Cm inpck Pq Fl inpck
Enable (disable) input parity
checking.
.It Cm istrip Pq Fl istrip
Strip (do not strip) input characters
to seven bits.
.It Cm inlcr Pq Fl inlcr
Map (do not map)
.Dv NL
to
.Dv CR
on input.
.It Cm igncr Pq Fl igncr
Ignore (do not ignore)
.Dv CR
on input.
.It Cm icrnl Pq Fl icrnl
Map (do not map)
.Dv CR
to
.Dv NL
on input.
.It Cm ixon Pq Fl ixon
Enable (disable)
.Dv START/STOP
output
control.
Output from the system is
stopped when the system receives
.Dv STOP
and started when the system
receives
.Dv START .
.It Cm ixoff Pq Fl ixoff
Request that the system send (not
send)
.Dv START/STOP
characters when
the input queue is nearly
empty/full.
.It Cm opost Pq Fl opost
Post-process output (do not
post-process output; ignore all other
output modes).
.It Cm isig Pq Fl isig
Enable (disable) the checking of
characters against the special control
characters
.Dv INTR , QUIT ,
and
.Dv SUSP .
.It Cm icanon Pq Fl icanon
Enable (disable) canonical input
.Pf ( Dv ERASE
and
.Dv KILL
processing).
.It Cm iexten Pq Fl iexten
Enable (disable) any implementation
defined special control characters
not currently controlled by icanon,
isig, or ixon.
.It Cm echo Pq Fl echo
Echo back (do not echo back) every
character typed.
.It Cm echoe Pq Fl echoe
The
.Dv ERASE
character shall (shall
not) visually erase the last character
in the current line from the
display, if possible.
.It Cm echok Pq Fl echok
Echo (do not echo)
.Dv NL
after
.Dv KILL
character.
.It Cm echonl Pq Fl echonl
Echo (do not echo)

even if echo
is disabled.
.It Cm noflsh Pq Fl noflsh
Disable (enable) flush after
.Dv INTR , QUIT , SUSP .
.It Cm control-character Ar string
Set control-character to string.
If string is a single character,
the control character is set to
that character.
If string is the
two character sequence "^-" or the
string "undef" the control character
is set to
.Pf { Dv _POSIX_VDISABLE Ns }
if
it is in effect for the device; if
.Pf { Dv _POSIX_VDISABLE Ns }
is not in effect
for the device, it is an
error.
.Pp
