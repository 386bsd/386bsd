.Sh NAME
.Nm df
.Nd display free disk space
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm df
.Op Fl ikn
.Op Ar file | Ar filesystem ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Df
displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the specified
.Ar filesystem
or on the filesystem of which
.Ar file
is a part.
Values are displayed in 512-byte per block block counts,
unless the 
.Fl k
option is specified, or the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
environment variable is set (see below).
If neither a file or a filesystem operand is specified,
statistics for all mounted filesystems are displayed.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Include statistics on the number of free inodes.
.It Fl k
The block counts are forced to be in 1K (1024 8-bit bytes) size blocks.
.It Fl n
Print out the previously obtained statistics from the filesystems.
This option should be used if it is possible that one or more
filesystems are in a state such that they will not be able to provide
statistics without a long delay.
When this option is specified,
.Nm df
will not request new statistics from the filesystems, but will respond
with the possibly stale statistics that were previously obtained.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environmental variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, the block counts will be displayed in units of that size block.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl n
flag is ignored if a file or filesystem is specified.
