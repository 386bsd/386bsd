		 SOFTWARE CONTRIBUTION FORM


     We are always pleased to look  at	enhancements,  addi-
tions or ports of public domain software for possible incor-
poration into 386BSD  releases.	However,  all	contributed
software must contain the following items:

1.   The author's name, date, and copyright (if any).  If  a
     modification  of  a  public-domain	work,	modification
     attribution and original author.

2.   A brief description of the software module or item.

3.   The following statement: "This  software  contains,  to
     the best of my knowledge, no proprietary, trade secret,
     or	otherwise  encumbered	code.	I  am  making	this
     software	available  for	incorporation  into  386BSD,
     understanding that 386BSD is a  freely  redistributable
     and modifiable system."

     In addition, the software should be  in  the  following
format:

1.   Release number upon which generated (0.0, 0.1, etc).

2.   Source code. Generated binary.

3.   List of known bugs.

     386BSD is a freely available work. All developers	sub-
mitting	software  for	official  386BSD  releases should be
aware of this fact. Given the extremely wide distribution of
this software, we cannot regulate or enforce specific usage,
license, or proprietary restrictions, nor can we collect any
monies	or  fees  for  use.  Those  developers	who  wish to
encumber their software in this	manner	should	find  other
mechanisms for distribution.

     We will not review or accept any code which  is  marked
"proprietary" or "trade secret".

     We suggest that copyrights (or copylefts) not  be	made
too "encumbering" in order to encourage usage, enhancements,
and modifications of the submitted software.   (For  a	sug-
gested	copyright format, we suggest the University of Cali-
fornia copyright format.)

     Due  to  constraints  on  distribution  size,  research
directions,  and  number of submissions, we cannot guarantee
that any particular piece of software will  be	incorporated
into  the  next release. However, we always encourage people
