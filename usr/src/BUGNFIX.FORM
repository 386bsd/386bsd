		    386BSD RELEASE 0.1
		  BUG AND FIX REPORT FORM


     386BSD is an experimental research system intended	for
exploration  and  study. The inclusion of source code allows
the creative and industrious student of operating systems to
modify,	correct,  augment and otherwise alter the system in
any manner desired.  Due to  the  "free"  nature  of  386BSD
Release 0.1, we cannot provide "on-demand" support.

     We do encourage feedback, however, on bug fixes,  prob-
lems  and  solutions  which  arise during configuration, and
improvements to 386BSD.	These changes will be	incorporated
back  into  the system, and made available once again to the
386BSD audience, to further encourage use of this system.

     Please complete this bug and fix report and return to:
