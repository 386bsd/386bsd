.Sh NAME
.Nm tftpd
.Nd
.Tn DARPA
Trivial File Transfer Protocol server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tftpd
.Op Ar directory ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Tftpd
is a server which supports the
.Tn DARPA
Trivial File Transfer
Protocol.
The
.Tn TFTP
server operates
at the port indicated in the
.Ql tftp
service description;
see
.Xr services 5 .
The server is normally started by
.Xr inetd 8 .
.Pp
The use of
.Xr tftp 1
does not require an account or password on the remote system.
Due to the lack of authentication information, 
.Nm tftpd
will allow only publicly readable files to be
accessed.
Files may be written only if they already exist and are publicly writable.
Note that this extends the concept of
.Dq public
to include
all users on all hosts that can be reached through the network;
this may not be appropriate on all systems, and its implications
should be considered before enabling tftp service.
The server should have the user ID with the lowest possible privilege.
.Pp
Access to files may be restricted by invoking
.Nm tftpd
with a list of directories by including pathnames
as server program arguments in
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf .
In this case access is restricted to files whose
names are prefixed by the one of the given directories.
