.SH NAME
crond \- daemon to execute scheduled commands (Vixie Cron)
.SH SYNOPSIS
crond
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Crond
should be started from /etc/rc or /etc/rc.local.  It will return immediately,
so you don't need to start it with '&'.
.PP
.I Crond
searches /var/cron/tabs for crontab files which are named after accounts in
/etc/passwd; crontabs found are loaded into memory.
.I Crond
then wakes up every minute, examining all stored crontabs, checking each
command to see if it should be run in the current minute.  When executing
commands, any output is mailed to the owner of the crontab (or to the user
named in the MAILTO environment variable in the crontab, if such exists).
.PP
Additionally,
.I crond
checks each minute to see if its spool directory's modtime has changed, and
if it has,
.I crond
will then examine the modtime on all crontabs and reload those which have
changed.  Thus
.I crond
need not be restarted whenever a crontab file is modified.  Note that the
.IR Crontab (1)
command updates the modtime of the spool directory whenever it changes a
crontab.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
crontab(1), crontab(5)
