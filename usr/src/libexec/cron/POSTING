This is version 3.0 of vixie-cron.  Previous versions are contained in
BSD/386, NetBSD, FreeBSD, 386BSD, Linux, and thousands of Usenet systems
where the local sysadmin has replaced the vendor's cron with this one. It is
essential that all systems using any previous version of this cron be
upgraded, since there are three major security holes in all previous
versions.  (Two of the security holes have been well-publicized; one has
not; the Linux/NetBSD fix for one of the publicized security holes actually 
adds a new hole, so even those systems ought to be upgraded to this cron.)

The other major difference between this and previous versions is that this one
has support for the 4.3BSD-style "/etc/crontab" file -- that's the one that has
an extra field between the time specification and the command; that field is a
user name.  Thus commands can be made to run as non-root users without the old
"* * * * * echo /usr/bin/rnews -U | su news" trick.  The support for this was
done by BSDi and contributed back to the public version of cron.

I have run an extensive beta test of this software using the alt.sources group;
this version of cron is known to compile and run on *BSD*, Linux, SunOS, OSF/1,
HP-UX, and several flavours of System V including the one running on Convex's
hardware.  I have run it in production here for many months, and it is part of
the upcoming 1.1 release of BSDi's BSD/386 operating system.

Briefly, this cron is better than the older BSD/V7 cron since it permits each
user on the system to have their own private crontab. It also logs each command
as it is run (using syslog or a local log file, depending on how you configure
it).  It does not contain "atrun" as does System V cron, and since those
systems do not have a separate "atrun" that this cron can run, it is unlikely
that any System V system will want to run this cron.

This cron complies with POSIX 1003.1.  Actually, this cron predates POSIX
1003.1's specification by a several years, but since the interface for this
cron and POSIX's cron are both based on AT&T System V's cron, the differences
were small and this latest version has been changed to the POSIX interface
where they differed.
