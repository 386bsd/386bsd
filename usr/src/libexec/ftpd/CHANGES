This version of ftpd has been fixed to conform to RFC959.

Unfortunately, this conformance introduces a user visible change.  While
technically, this is the fault of the client (ftp) instead of the server
(ftpd), the change will be seen whenever an old ftp client calls a new ftpd
server.

The problem is that the old ftpd implemented the NLST command by execing
/bin/ls.  This produced non-conformant output in some cases.  The new
ftpd no longer executes /bin/ls for the NLST command as it has it's own
built-in code.

The user visible change in the ftp behavior is caused by the ftp client
"knowing" that the daemon will exec /bin/ls.  This assumption should not
have been made.

When the old ftp client is used, one of the options is the "ls" command
which sends the command NLST to the ftpd server.  The client should really
be sending the LIST command.  The new ftp client has been corrected to do
this.

NLST should not normally be used directly by humans.  It is intended to
interface with commands like mget or mput.

Users who are not able to upgrade their ftp client may obtain the previous
behavior, by using the command "dir" instead of "ls".

These changes only apply to those sites using code derived from the Berkeley
software releases (which means almost every UNIX based implementation will
see this problem).
