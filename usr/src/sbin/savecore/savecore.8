.Sh NAME
.Nm savecore
.Nd "save the details of a crash of the operating system"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm savecore
.Ar dirname
.Op Ar system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Savecore
is meant to be called near the end of the initialization file
.Pa /etc/rc
(see
.Xr rc 8 ) .
Its function
is to detect the presence and save the state of the operating
system's previous abnormal termination, assuming the state was recorded
for this purpose. If this state information is found,
.Nm savecore
will also write a reboot message in the shutdown log.
The state information is a snapshot of all RAM memory at the time
of abnormal termination, untranslated by the processor's memory management
unit, in physical rather than virtual order (like the memory device, see
.Xr mem 4 ).
.Pp
Operands supported by
.Nm savecore :
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar dirname
The directory name where the core dump will be written.
.It Ar system
If the core dump was from a system other than
.Pa /386bsd ,
the name
of that system must be supplied as
.Ar system .
.El
.Pp
.Nm Savecore
looks for a physical RAM memory image of the current system
(currently recorded during system crashes in the
system's swap space) and it checks the image for veracity.
If the saved memory image is valid, it saves this in
.Ar dirname Ns Pa /ram.n
and the current version of the operating system's executable file
in
.Ar dirname Ns Pa /system.n
Sequence numbers are incremented and appended to the end of the pathnames
each time
.Nm savecore
is run in the directory.
.Pp
Before savecore writes out a memory image, it reads a number from the file
.Ar dirname Ns Pa /minfree .
If the number of free kilobytes on the filesystem which contains
.Ar dirname
is less than the number obtained from the minfree file,
the core dump is not saved.
If the minfree file does not exist, savecore always writes out the core
file (assuming that a core dump was taken).
.Pp
.Nm Savecore
also logs a reboot message using facility
.Dv LOG_AUTH
(see
.Xr syslog 3 )
If the system crashed as a result of a panic,
.Nm savecore
logs the panic string too.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /386bsd -compact
.It Pa /386bsd
current
.Tn system executable file
.El
.Sh BUGS
Can be fooled into thinking a core dump is the wrong size.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.1 .
