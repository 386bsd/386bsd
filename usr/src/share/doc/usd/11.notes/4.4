.se "Statistics"

	The notesfile system keeps statistics on where notes and responses
originate, the number of network accesses, duplications and orphaned 
responses.
Combined with the use of the log maintained by the notesfile
networking software,
monitoring notesfile traffic is
quite easy.

	The -s option specifies that only a summary is to be produced,
skipping the individual reports.
Wildcard constructs with '*', '?', '[', and ']' are
recognized by nfstats.
Invoke the statistics program with:

		nfstats [ -s ] topic1 [ ... ]

Typical output is:

	A combined set of statistics is produced at the end of listings
of more than one notesfile.
The statistics are largely self explanatory.
