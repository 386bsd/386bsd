# @(#)pacificnew	4.4

# From Arthur David Olson (January 18, 1989):
# On November 10, 1987, the U. S. House of Representatives passed a bill
# (H.R. 435), the "Uniform Poll Closing Time Act", establishing
# "Pacific Presidential Election Time"; it was not acted on by the Senate
# before the end of the 100th Congress and so died.
# The bill has been reintroduced in the 101st Congress as H. R. 18;
# H. R. 96 also deals with poll closing time.  Either bill would have to be
# passed by both the House and Senate and signed by the President (or have
# the President's veto overridden by the House and Senate) before becoming law.
