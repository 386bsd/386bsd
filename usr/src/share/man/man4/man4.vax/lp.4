.Sh NAME
.Nm lp
.Nd line printer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device lp0 at uba0 csr 0177514 vector lpintr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm lp
device
supports
.Tn DEC
and
.Tn DEC
compatible printers
on the
.Tn LP-11
parallel interface.
.Pp
The unit number of the printer is specified by the minor device
after removing the low 3 bits, which act as per-device parameters.
Currently only the lowest of the low three bits is interpreted:
if it is set, the device is assumed to have a 64-character set or
.Pf half Tn -ASCII
mode,
rather than a full 96-character set.
.Pp
If the 64-character set is assumed,
any lower case characters are mapped to upper case; left curly and
right curly braces are mapped to left and right parentheses over
laid with a hyphen; grave accents are mapped to acute accents
with overlaid with a hyphen; the pipe bar character is mapped
to an exclamation sign overlaid with a hyphen; and the tilde
character is mapped to a carat overlaid with a hyphen.
.Pp
The default page width is 132 columns; longer lines are
truncated.
This may be overridden by specifying, for example,
.Ql flags 256 .
