.Sh NAME
.Nm hp
.Nd
.Tn MASSBUS
disk interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "disk hp0 at mba0 drive 0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm hp
driver
is a generic Massbus disk driver which handles both the standard
.Tn DEC
controllers and the Emulex
.Tn SC750
and
.Tn SC780
controllers.
It is typical of a block-device disk driver; block
.Tn I/O
is
described in
.Xr physio 4 .
.Pp
The script
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
should be used to create the special files; if a special file
needs to be created by hand consult
.Xr mknod 8 .
It is recommended as a security precaution to not create special files
for devices which may never be installed.
.Pp
The first sector of each disk contains both a first-stage bootstrap program
and a disk label containing geometry information and partition layouts (see
.Xr disklabel 5 .
This sector is normally write-protected, and disk-to-disk copies should
avoid copying this sector.
The label may be updated with
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
which can also be used to write-enable and write-disable the sector.
The next 15 sectors contain a second-stage bootstrap program.
.Sh DISK SUPPORT
This driver handles both standard
.Tn DEC
controllers and Emulex
.Tn SC750
and
.Tn SC780
controllers.
During autoconfiguration or whenever a drive comes on line for the first time,
or when a drive is opened after all partitions are closed,
the first sector of the drive is examined for a disk label.
If a label is found, the geometry of the drive and the partition tables
are taken from it.
If no label is found,
standard
.Tn DEC
drive types are
recognized according to the
.Tn MASSBUS
drive type register,
and default partitions are used.
For the Emulex controller the drive type register should be configured
to indicate the drive is an
.Tn RM02 .
When this is encountered,
the driver checks the holding register to find out
the disk geometry and, based on this information, decides what
the drive type is.
.Pp
Special file names begin with
.Sq Li hp
and
.Sq Li rhp
for the block and character files respectively. The second
component of the name, a drive unit number in the range of zero to
seven, is represented by a
.Sq Li ?
in the disk layouts below.
The last component is the file system partition
designated
by a letter from
.Sq Li a
to
.Sq Li h
and also corresponds to a minor device number set: zero to seven,
eight to 15, 16 to 23 and so forth for drive zero, drive two and drive
three respectively.
The following disks are supported:
.Tn RM03 ,
.Tn RM05 ,
.Tn RP06 ,
.Tn RM80 ,
.Tn RP05 ,
.Tn RP07 ,
.Tn ML11A ,

The hp?a partition is normally used for the root file system,
the hp?b partition as a paging area,
and the hp?c partition for pack-pack copying (it maps the entire disk).
On disks larger than about 205 Megabytes, the hp?h partition
is inserted prior to the hp?d or hp?g partition;
the hp?g partition then maps the remainder of the pack.
All disk partition tables are calculated using the
.Xr diskpart 8
program.

.Bl -diag
.It "hp%d%c: hard error %sing fsbn %d [of %d-%d] (hp%d bn %d cn %d tn %d sn %d) mbsr=%b er1=%b er2=%b."
An unrecoverable error occurred during transfer of the specified
filesystem block number,
which is a logical block number on the indicated partition.
If the transfer involved multiple blocks, the block range is printed as well.
The parenthesized fields list the actual disk sector number
relative to the beginning of the drive,
as well as the cylinder, track and sector number of the block.
The
.Tn MASSBUS
status register is printed in hexadecimal and
with the error bits decoded if any error bits other than
.Tn MBEXC
and
.Tn DTABT
are set.  In any case the contents of the two error registers are also printed
in octal and symbolically with bits decoded.
(Note that er2 is what old
.Tn RP06
manuals would call
.Tn RPER3 ;
the terminology
is that of the
.Tn RM
disks).
The error was either unrecoverable, or a large number of retry attempts
(including offset positioning and drive recalibration) could not
recover the error.
.Pp
.It hp%d: write locked.
The write protect switch was set on the drive
when a write was attempted.  The write operation is not recoverable.
.Pp
.It hp%d: not ready .
The drive was spun down or off line when it was
accessed.  The
.Tn I/O
operation is not recoverable.
.Pp
.It "hp%d%c: soft ecc reading fsbn %d [of %d-%d] (hp%d bn %d cn %d tn %d sn %d)."
A recoverable
.Tn ECC
error occurred on the
specified sector of the specified disk partition. 
If the transfer involved multiple blocks, the block range is printed as well.
The parenthesized fields list the actual disk sector number
relative to the beginning of the drive,
as well as the cylinder, track and sector number of the block.
This happens normally
a few times a week.  If it happens more frequently than
this the sectors where the errors are occurring should be checked to see
if certain cylinders on the pack, spots on the carriage of the drive
or heads are indicated.

During autoconfiguration one of the above messages may appear
on the console indicating the appropriate drive type was recognized.
The last message indicates the drive is of a unknown type.
In this case, the correct geometry is set, and one partition is created
that contains the entire drive.
