.Nm intro
.Nd introduction to special files and hardware support
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This section describes the special files, related driver functions,
and networking support
available in the system.
In this part of the manual, the
.Tn SYNOPSIS
section of
each configurable device gives a sample specification
for use in constructing a system description for the
.Xr config 8
program.
The
.Tn DIAGNOSTICS
section lists messages which may appear on the console
and/or in the system error log
.Pa /var/log/messages
due to errors in device operation;
see
.Xr syslogd 8
for more information.
.Sh VAX DEVICE SUPPORT
This section describes the hardware supported on the
.Tn DEC
.Tn VAX-11 .
Software support for these devices comes in two forms.  A hardware
device may be supported with a character or block
.Em device driver ,
or it may be used within the networking subsystem and have a
.Em network interface driver .
Block and character devices are accessed through files in the file
system of a special type; see
.Xr physio 4
and
.Xr mknod 8 .
Network interfaces are indirectly accessed through the interprocess
communication facilities provided by the system; see
.Xr socket 2 .
.Pp
A hardware device is identified to the system at configuration time
and the appropriate device or network interface driver is then compiled
into the system.  When the resultant system is booted, the
autoconfiguration facilities in the system probe for the device
on either the
.Tn UNIBUS
(or
.Tn Q-bus )
or
.Tn MASSBUS
and, if found, enable the software
support for it.  If a
.Tn UNIBUS
device does not respond at autoconfiguration
time it is not accessible at any time afterwards.  To
enable a
.Tn UNIBUS
device which did not autoconfigure, the system will have to
be rebooted.  If a
.Tn MASSBUS
device comes
.Dq on-line
after the autoconfiguration sequence
it will be dynamically autoconfigured into the running system.
.Pp
The autoconfiguration system is described in
.Xr autoconf 4 .
A list of the supported devices is given below.

.Sh LIST OF DEVICES
The devices listed below are supported in this incarnation of
the system.  Pseudo-devices are not listed.
Devices are indicated by their functional interface.
If second vendor products provide functionally identical interfaces
they should be usable with the supplied software.
.Bf -symbolic
Beware,
however, that we promise the software works
ONLY with the hardware indicated on the appropriate manual page.
.Ef
Occasionally, new devices of a similar type may be added
simply by creating appropriate table entries in the driver.
