.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd
.Tn HP AMD
7990
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device le0 at scode?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm le
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn AMD
7990
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl .
The
.Xr le
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Pp
The use of ``trailer'' encapsulation to minimize copying data on
input and output is supported by the interface but offers no advantage
due to the large
.Tn HP
page size.
The use of trailers is negotiated with
.Tn ARP .
This negotiation may be disabled, on a per-interface basis,
by setting the
.Dv IFF_NOTRAILERS
flag with an
.Dv SIOCSIFFLAGS
.Xr ioctl .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It le%d: hardware address %s.
This is a normal autoconfiguration message noting the 6 byte physical
ethernet address of the adapter.
.Pp
.It de%d: can't handle af%d.
The interface was handed
a message with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address
family; the packet was dropped.
.Pp
The following message indicate a possible hardware error performing
the indicated operation during autoconfiguration or initialization.
.Pp
.It le%d: init timeout, stat = 0x%x.
The hardware did not respond to an initialize command during reset.
The reset procedure continues anyway.
