.Sh NAME
.Nm drtest
.Nd standalone disk test program
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Drtest
is a standalone program used to read a disk 
track by track. 
It was primarily intended as a test program 
for new standalone drivers, but has shown
useful in other contexts as well, such as 
verifying disks and running speed
tests. For example, when a disk has been formatted
(by
.Xr format 8 ) ,
you can check that
hard errors has been taken care of by running 
.Nm drtest .
No hard errors should be found, but in many cases 
quite a few soft
.Tn ECC
errors will be reported.
.Pp
While
.Nm drtest
is running, the cylinder number is printed on
the console for every 10th cylinder read.
.Sh EXAMPLE
A sample run of 
.Xr drtest
is shown below.  
In this example (using a 750), 
.Nm drtest
is loaded from the root file system;
usually it
will be loaded from the machine's
console storage device.  Boldface means user input.
As usual, ``#'' and ``@'' may be used to edit input.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics are intended to be self explanatory. Note, however, that 
the device number
in the diagnostic messages is identified as
.Em typeX
instead of 
.Em type(a,u)
where
.Ar X
\&= a*8+u, e.g., hp(1,3) becomes hp11.
