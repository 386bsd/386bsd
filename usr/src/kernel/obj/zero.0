     zzeerroo - the zero-fill device

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The zzeerroo device reads as if an infinitely long file of zeros.  Like the
     null(4) device, the zzeerroo device accepts and reads data as any ordinary
     (and willing) file - but throws it away. The length of the zzeerroo device is
     always zero.
