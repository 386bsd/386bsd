 * This file contains definitions for some cdrom control commands
 * and status codes. This info was "inherited" from the DOS MTMCDE.SYS
 * driver, and is thus not complete (and may even be wrong). Some day
 * the manufacturer or anyone else might provide better documentation,
 * so this file (and the driver) will then have a better quality.
