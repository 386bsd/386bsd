/*
 *  This is the pc filesystem specific portion of the
 *  vnode structure.
 *  To describe a file uniquely the de_dirclust, de_diroffset,
 *  and de_de.deStartCluster fields are used.  de_dirclust
 *  contains the cluster number of the directory cluster containing
 *  the entry for a file or directory.  de_diroffset is the
 *  index into the cluster for the entry describing a file
 *  or directory.  de_de.deStartCluster is the number of the
 *  first cluster of the file or directory.  Now to describe the
 *  quirks of the pc filesystem.
 *  - Clusters 0 and 1 are reserved.
 *  - The first allocatable cluster is 2.
 *  - The root directory is of fixed size and all blocks that
 *    make it up are contiguous.
 *  - Cluster 0 refers to the root directory when it is found
 *    in the startcluster field of a directory entry that points
 *    to another directory.
 *  - Cluster 0 implies a 0 length file when found in the start
 *    cluster field of a directory entry that points to a file.
 *  - You can't use the cluster number 0 to derive
 *    the address of the root directory.
 *  - Multiple directory entries can point to a directory.
 *    The entry in the parent directory points to a child
 *    directory.  Any directories in the child directory contain
 *    a ".." entry that points back to the child.  The child
 *    directory itself contains a "." entry that points to
 *    itself.
 *  - The root directory does not contain a "." or ".." entry.
 *  - Directory entries for directories are never changed once
 *    they are created (except when removed).  The size stays
 *    0, and the last modification time is never changed.  This
 *    is because so many directory entries can point to the physical
 *    clusters that make up a directory.  It would lead to an update
 *    nightmare.
 *  - The length field in a directory entry pointing to a directory
 *    contains 0 (always).  The only way to find the end of a directory
 *    is to follow the cluster chain until the "last cluster"
 *    marker is found.
 *  My extensions to make this house of cards work.  These apply
 *  only to the in memory copy of the directory entry.
 *  - A reference count for each denode will be kept since dos doesn't
 *    keep such things.
