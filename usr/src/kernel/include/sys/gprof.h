    /*
     *	Fraction of text space to allocate for from hash buckets.
     *	The value of HASHFRACTION is based on the minimum number of bytes
     *	of separation between two subroutine call points in the object code.
     *	Given MIN_SUBR_SEPARATION bytes of separation the value of
     *	HASHFRACTION is calculated as:
     *
     *		HASHFRACTION = MIN_SUBR_SEPARATION / (2 * sizeof(short) - 1);
     *
     *	For the VAX, the shortest two call sequence is:
     *
     *		calls	$0,(r0)
     *		calls	$0,(r0)
     *
     *	which is separated by only three bytes, thus HASHFRACTION is 
     *	calculated as:
     *
     *		HASHFRACTION = 3 / (2 * 2 - 1) = 1
     *
     *	Note that the division above rounds down, thus if MIN_SUBR_FRACTION
     *	is less than three, this algorithm will not work!
     *
     *	NB: for the kernel we assert that the shortest two call sequence is:
     *
     *		calls	$0,_name
     *		calls	$0,_name
     *
     *	which is separated by seven bytes, thus HASHFRACTION is calculated as:
     *
     *		HASHFRACTION = 7 / (2 * 2 - 1) = 2
