.Sh DESCRIPTION
386BSD
provides some packet routing facilities.
The kernel maintains a routing information database, which
is used in selecting the appropriate network interface when
transmitting packets. These facilities are implemented in a
module that provides routing independant of protocol.
.Pp
A user process (or possibly multiple co-operating processes)
maintains this database by sending messages over a special kind
of socket.
This supplants fixed size
.Xr ioctl 2 Ns 's
used in earlier releases.
Routing table changes may only be carried out by the super user.
.Pp
The operating system may spontaneously emit routing messages in response
to external events, such as recipt of a re-direct, or failure to
locate a suitable route for a request.
The message types are described in greater detail below.
.Pp
Routing database entries come in two flavors: for a specific
host, or for all hosts on a generic subnetwork (as specified
by a bit mask and value under the mask.
The effect of wildcard or default route may be achieved by using
a mask of all zeros, and there may be hierarchical routes.
.Pp
When the system is booted and addresses are assigned
to the network interfaces, each protocol family
installs a routing table entry for each interface when it is ready for traffic.
Normally the protocol specifies the route
through each interface as a
.Dq direct
connection to the destination host
or network.  If the route is direct, the transport layer of
a protocol family usually requests the packet be sent to the
same host specified in the packet.  Otherwise, the interface
is requested to address the packet to the gateway listed in the routing entry
(i.e. the packet is forwarded).
.Pp
When routing a packet,
the kernel will first attempt to find a route to the destination host.
Failing that, a search is made for a route to the network of the destination.
Finally, any route to a default
.Pq Dq wildcard
gateway is chosen.
If no entry is found, the destination is declared to be unreachable,
and a routing\-miss message is generated if there are any
listers on the routing control socket described below.
.Pp
A wildcard routing entry is specified with a zero
destination address value.  Wildcard routes are used
only when the system fails to find a route to the
destination host and network.  The combination of wildcard
routes and routing redirects can provide an economical
mechanism for routing traffic.
.Pp
One opens the channel for passing routing control messasges
by using the socket call shown in the synopsis above:
.Pp
The
.Fa family
paramter may be
.Dv AF_UNSPEC
which will provide
routing information for all address families, or can be restricted
to a specific address family by specifying which one is desired.
There can be more than one routing socket open per system.
.Pp
Messages are formed by a header followed by a small
number of sockadders (now variable length particularly
in the
.Tn ISO
case), interpreted by position, and delimited
by the new length entry in the sockaddr.
An example of a message with four addresses might be an
.Tn ISO
redirect:
Destination, Netmask, Gateway, and Author of the redirect.
The interpretation of which address are present is given by a
bit mask within the header, and the sequence is least significant
to most significant bit within the vector.
.Pp
Any messages sent to the kernel are returned, and copies are sent
to all interested listeners.  The kernel will provide the process
id. for the sender, and the sender may use an additional sequence
field to distinguish between outstanding messages.  However,
message replies may be lost when kernel buffers are exhausted.
.Pp
The kernel may reject certain messages, and will indicate this
by filling in the
.Ar rtm_errno
field.
The routing code returns
.Dv EEXIST
if
requested to duplicate an existing entry,
.Dv ESRCH
if
requested to delete a non-existent entry,
or
.Dv ENOBUFS
if insufficient resources were available
to install a new route.
In the current implementation, all routing process run locally,
and the values for
.Ar rtm_errno
are available through the normal
.Em errno
mechanism, even if the routing reply message is lost.
.Pp
A process may avoid the expense of reading replies to
its own messages by issuing a
.Xr setsockopt 2
call indicating that the
.Dv SO_USELOOPBACK
option
at the
.Dv SOL_SOCKET
level is to be turned off.
A process may ignore all messages from the routing socket
by doing a 
.Xr shutdown 2
system call for further input.
.Pp
If a route is in use when it is deleted,
the routing entry will be marked down and removed from the routing table,
but the resources associated with it will not
be reclaimed until all references to it are released. 
User processes can obtain information about the routing
entry to a specific destination by using a
.Dv RTM_GET
message,
or by reading the
.Pa /dev/kmem
device, or by issuing a
.Xr getkerninfo 2
system call.
