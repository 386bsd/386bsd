This directory contains the source files for sendmail.

For installation instructions, please read the document ../doc/op.me:

	nroff -me ../doc/op.me

The following list describes the files in this directory:

Makefile	The makefile used here; this is created from
		makefile.m4.
Makefile.m4	A makefile template.
READ_ME		This file.
TODO		New features to be put in (maybe) at some time.
Version.c	The version number and information about this
		version of sendmail.  Theoretically, this gets
		modified on every change.
alias.c		Does name aliasing in all forms.
arpadate.c	A subroutine which creates ARPANET standard dates.
clock.c		Routines to implement real-time oriented functions
		in sendmail -- e.g., timeouts.
collect.c	The routine that actually reads the mail into a temp
		file.  It also does a certain amount of parsing of
		the header, etc.
conf.c		The configuration file.  This contains information
		that is presumed to be quite static and non-
		controversial, or code compiled in for efficiency
		reasons.  Most of the configuration is in sendmail.cf.
conf.h		Configuration that must be known everywhere.
convtime.c	A routine to sanely process times.
daemon.c	Routines to implement daemon mode.  This version is
		specifically for Berkeley 4.1 IPC.
deliver.c	Routines to deliver mail.
err.c		Routines to print error messages.
envelope.c	Routines to manipulate the envelope structure.
headers.c	Routines to process message headers.
macro.c		The macro expander.  This is used internally to
		insert information from the configuration file.
main.c		The main routine to sendmail.  This file also
		contains some miscellaneous routines.
parseaddr.c	The routines which do address parsing.
queue.c		Routines to implement message queueing.
readcf.c	The routine that reads the configuration file and
		translates it to internal form.
recipient.c	Routines that manipulate the recipient list.
savemail.c	Routines which save the letter on processing errors.
sendmail.h	Main header file for sendmail.
srvrsmtp.c	Routines to implement server SMTP.
stab.c		Routines to manage the symbol table.
stats.c		Routines to collect and post the statistics.
sysexits.c	List of error messages associated with error codes
		in sysexits.h.
trace.c		The trace package.  These routines allow setting and
		testing of trace flags with a high granularity.
trace.h		Definitions needed for the trace package.
usersmtp.c	Routines to implement user SMTP.
util.c		Some general purpose routines used by sendmail.
version.c	A master file for Version.c -- it may not exist in
		your distribution.
