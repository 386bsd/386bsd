Everything in this directory is site dependent.  It contains info
such as UUCP host lists, SMTPUUCP host lists, etc.  The idea here
is that there is one .m4 file for every generic type of configuration
file, and can be one .m4 file for hosts that have oddball needs.


On okeeffe:

To edit one of these files (say to add a uucp host), do

	sccs edit file

make your changes, and then do

	sccs delget file

Then cd to ../cf and do a "make".
