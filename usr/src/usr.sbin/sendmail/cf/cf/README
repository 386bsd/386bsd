This directory contains cf files for these machines:

	cad		/* cad.berkeley.edu */
	cadgroup	/* any cadgroup machine */
	cc		/* computer center microvax */
	cchem		/* any machine in college of chemistry */
	cogsci		/* cogsci (to deal with uucp link) */
	ic		/* ic (to deal with uucp link) */
	okeeffe		/* okeeffe (to deal with uucp link) */
	ucbarpa		/* ucbarpa (to deal with uucp link) */
	ucbvax		/* ucbvax (to deal with uucp link) */

	ucbproto.cf	/* any Berkeley nameserver/hosttable machine */

	tcpproto.cf	/* any TCP/IP (SMTP) based machine */
	uucproto.cf	/* any UUCP only machine */
	tcpuucpproto.cf	/* a UUCP hub on a TCP/IP (SMTP) network */

Most all of the good stuff is contained in proto.mc.  For all
machines except ucbvax, all the .mc files do is define some m4
constants and include proto.mc.

To make a file, say

	make cad.cf

for example.

N.B.: if you intend to maintain configuration files for more than
one or two machines, you should probably create ".mc" files along
the lines of the machine names above and use m4.  If you just try
to modify ".cf" files you'll eventually go insane.
