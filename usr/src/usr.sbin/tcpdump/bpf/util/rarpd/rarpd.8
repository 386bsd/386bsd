.SH NAME
rarpd \- Reverse ARP Daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.B rarpd 
[
.B \-af
]
[
.I interface
]
.br
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I Rarpd
services Reverse ARP requests on the Ethernet connected to
.I interface.
Upon receiving a request, 
.Irarpd
maps the target hardware address to an IP address via its name, which 
must be present in both the
.I ethers(5)
and 
.I hosts(5)
databases.
If a host does not exist in both databses, the translation cannot
proceed and a reply will not be sent.

Additionally, a request is honored only if the server
(i.e., the host that rarpd is running on)
can "boot" the target; that is, if the directory 
/tftpboot/\fIipaddr\fP
exists, where \fIipaddr\fP is the target IP address.

In normal operation, 
.I rarpd
forks a copy of itself and runs in
the background.  Anomalies and errors are reported via 
.I syslog(3).

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP
.B \-a
Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.
If `-a' is omitted, an interface must be specified.

.B \-f
