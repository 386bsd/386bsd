.Sh NAME
.Nm mount ,
.Nm unmount
.Nd mount or dismount a filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/mount.h>
.Ft int
.Fn mount "int type" "const char *dir" "int flags" "caddr_t data"
.Ft int
.Fn unmount "const char *dir" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mount
function grafts
a filesystem object onto the system file tree
at the point
.Ar dir .
The argument
.Ar data
describes the filesystem object to be mounted.
The argument
.Ar type
tells the kernel how to interpret
.Ar data
(See
.Ar type
below).
The contents of the filesystem
become available through the new mount point
.Ar dir .
Any files in
.Ar dir
at the time
of a successful mount are swept under the carpet so to speak, and
are unavailable until the filesystem is unmounted.
.Pp
The following
.Ar flags
may be specified to
suppress default semantics which affect filesystem access.
.Bl -tag -width M_SYNCHRONOUS
.It Dv M_RDONLY
The file system should be treated as read-only;
Even the super-user may not write on it.
.It Dv M_NOEXEC
Do not allow files to be executed from the file system.
.It Dv M_NOSUID
Do not honor setuid or setgid bits on files when executing them.
.It Dv M_NODEV
Do not interpret special files on the file system.
.It Dv M_SYNCHRONOUS
All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously.
.El
.Pp
The flag
.Dv M_UPDATE
indicates that the mount command is being applied 
to an already mounted file system.
This allows the mount flags to be changed without requiring
that the file system be unmounted and remounted.
Some file systems may not allow all flags to be changed.
For example,
most file systems will not allow a change from read-write to read-only.
.Pp
The
.Fa type
argument defines the type of the file system.
The types of file systems known to the system are defined in
.Aq Pa sys/mount.h .
.Fa Data
is a pointer to a structure that contains the type
specific arguments to mount.
The currently supported types of file systems and
their type specific data are:
.Pp
.Dv MOUNT_UFS
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
struct ufs_args {
      char	*fspec;  /* Block special file to mount */
      int	exflags; /* export related flags */
      uid_t	exroot;  /* mapping for root uid */
};
.Ed
.Pp
.Dv MOUNT_NFS
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
struct nfs_args {
      struct sockaddr_in *addr; /* file server address */
      nfsv2fh_t *fh;       /* File handle to be mounted */
      int       flags;     /* flags */
      int       wsize;     /* write size in bytes */
      int       rsize;     /* read size in bytes */
      int       timeo;     /* initial timeout 0.1 secs */
      int       retrans;   /* times to retry send */
      char      *hostname; /* server's name */
};
.Ed
.Pp
.Dv MOUNT_MFS
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
struct mfs_args {
      char	*name;	/* name of backing process */
      caddr_t	base;	/* base address of the file system */
      u_long	size;	/* size of the file system */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn umount
function call disassociates the filesystem from the specified
mount point
.Fa dir .
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument may have one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width  M_SYNCHRONOUS
.It Dv MNT_NOFORCE
The unmount should fail if any files are active on the file system.
.It Dv MNT_FORCE
The file system should be forcibly unmounted even if files are
still active.
Active special devices continue to work,
but any further accesses to any other active files result in errors
even if the file system is later remounted.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn mount
returns the value 0 if the mount was successful, otherwise -1 is returned
and the variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Pp
.Nm Umount
returns the value 0 if the umount succeeded; otherwise -1 is returned
and the variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn Mount
will fail when one of the following occurs:
