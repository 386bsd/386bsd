.Dt BIND 2
.Os BSD 4.2
.Sh NAME
.Nm bind
.Nd bind a name to a socket
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Ft int
.Fn bind "int s" "struct sockaddr *name" "int namelen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Bind
assigns a name to an unnamed socket.
When a socket is created 
with
.Xr socket 2
it exists in a name space (address family)
but has no name assigned.
.Fn Bind
requests that
.Fa name
be assigned to the socket.
.Sh NOTES
Binding a name in the UNIX domain creates a socket in the file
system that must be deleted by the caller when it is no longer
needed (using
.Xr unlink 2 ) .
.Pp
The rules used in name binding vary between communication domains.
Consult the manual entries in section 4 for detailed information.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the bind is successful, a 0 value is returned.
A return value of -1 indicates an error, which is
further specified in the global
.Va errno .
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn bind
call will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width EADDRNOTAVA
.It Bq Er EBADF
.Fa S
is not a valid descriptor.
.It Bq Er ENOTSOCK
.Fa S
is not a socket.
.It Bq Er EADDRNOTAVAIL
The specified address is not available from the local machine.
.It Bq Er EADDRINUSE
The specified address is already in use.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The socket is already bound to an address.
.It Bq Er EACCES
The requested address is protected, and the current user
has inadequate permission to access it.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa name
parameter is not in a valid part of the user
address space.
.El
.Pp
The following errors are specific to binding names in the UNIX domain.
.Bl -tag -width EADDRNOTAVA
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit set.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters,
or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
A prefix component of the path name does not exist.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry or allocating the inode.
.It Bq Er EROFS
The name would reside on a read-only file system.
.It Bq Er EISDIR
An empty pathname was specified.
