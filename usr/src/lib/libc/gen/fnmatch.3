.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fnmatch
.Nd match filename or pathname
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn fnmatch "const char *pattern" "const char *string" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fnmatch
function
matches patterns according to the rules used by the shell.
It checks the string specified by the
.Fa string
argument to see if it matches the pattern specified by the
.Fa pattern
argument.
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument modifies the interpretation of
.Fa pattern
and
.Fa string .
The value of
.Fa flags
is the bitwise inclusive
.Tn OR
of any of the following
constants, which are defined in the include file
.Pa unistd.h .
.Bl -tag -width FNM_PATHNAME
.It Dv FNM_PATHNAME
Slash characters in
.Fa string
must be explicitly matched by slashes in
.Fa pattern .
If this flag is not set, then slashes are treated as regular characters.
.It Dv FNM_QUOTE
Every occurrence of a backslash
.Pq Ql \e
followed by a character in
.Fa pattern
is replaced by that character.
This is done to negate any special meaning for the character.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If
.Fa string
matches the pattern specified by
.Fa pattern ,
then
.Fn fnmatch
returns zero.
Otherwise,
.Fn fnmatch
returns nonzero.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr glob 3 ,
.Xr wordexp 3 ,
.Xr regexp 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn fnmatch
function is
.Ud .
.Sh BUGS
Quotes and slashes in range patterns are not handled correctly.
.Pp
The pattern
.Ql *
matches the empty string, even if
.Dv FNM_PATHNAME
is specified.
