/*
 * A record in the tree is either a pointer to a page and an index in the page

 * entry and search returns as well as to pass records to other routines.
 *
 * One comment about searches.  Internal page searches must find the largest
 * record less than key in the tree so that descents work.  Leaf page searches
 * must find the smallest record greater than key so that the returned index
 * is the record's correct position for insertion.
 *
 * One comment about cursors.  The cursor key is never removed from the tree,
 * even if deleted.  This is because it is quite difficult to decide where the
 * cursor should be when other keys have been inserted/deleted in the tree;
 * duplicate keys make it impossible.  This scheme does require extra work
 * though, to make sure that we don't perform an operation on a deleted key.
