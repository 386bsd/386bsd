============================================
1.5 -> 1.6	06 Jun 1993
	hash:	In PAIRFITS, the first comparison should look at (P)[2].
		The hash_realloc function was walking off the end of memory.
		The overflow page number was wrong when bumping splitpoint.
1.4 -> 1.5	23 May 1993
	hash:	Set hash default fill factor dynamically.
	recno:	Fixed bug in sorted page splits.
		Add page size parameter support.
		Allow recno to specify the name of the underlying btree;
			used for vi recovery.
	btree/recno:
		Support 64K pages.
	btree/hash/recno:
		Provide access to an underlying file descriptor.
		Change sync routines to take a flag argument, recno
			uses this to sync out the underlying btree.
