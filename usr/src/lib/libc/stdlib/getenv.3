.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions set, unset and fetch environment variables from the
host
.Em environment list .
For compatibility with differing environment conventions,
the given arguments

.Ar value
may be appended and prepended,

If the variable does exist, the argument
.Ar overwrite
is tested; if

zero, the
variable is not reset, otherwise it is reset
to the given
.Ar value .
