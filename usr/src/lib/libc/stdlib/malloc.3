.Sh NAME
.Nm malloc ,
.Nd general memory allocation function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <stdlib.h>
.Ft void *
.Fn malloc "size_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn malloc
function allocates uninitialized space for an object whose
size is specified by
.Fa size .
The
.Fn malloc
function maintains multiple lists of free blocks according to size, allocating
space from the appropriate list.
.Pp
The allocated space is
suitably aligned (after possible pointer
coercion) for storage of any type of object. If the space is of
.Em pagesize
or larger, the memory returned will be page-aligned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn malloc
function returns
a pointer to the allocated space if successful; otherwise
a null pointer is returned.
