.Sh NAME
.Nm curses
.Nd screen functions with ``optimal'' cursor motion
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cc
.Op Ar flags
.Ar files
.Fl lcurses ltermcap
.Op Ar libraries
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These routines give the user a method of updating screens with reasonable
optimization.  They keep an image of the current screen,
and the user sets up an image of a new one.  Then the
.Fn refresh
tells the routines to make the current screen look like the new one.
In order to initialize the routines, the routine
.Fn initscr
must be called before any of the other routines that deal with windows and
screens are used.  The routine
.Fn endwin
should be called before exiting.
