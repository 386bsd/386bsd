          not to be necessary or useful

        * CursesW.h, curses.h: removed touchline and touchoverlap,
          since they are apparently nonstandard, and aren't supported
          in most C curses libraries.

        * Removed test0 and twrapper from tests, since
          they are not fully supported in g++-1.39.0

Sat Jan 26 05:24:22 1991  Doug Lea  (dl at g.oswego.edu)

        * signal.h: Reinstate full path name of C version of signal.h

Sun Oct 28 05:32:30 1990  Doug Lea  (dl at g.oswego.edu)

Thu Oct 11 05:50:34 1990  Doug Lea  (dl at g.oswego.edu)

          classes in constructors

Sat Oct  6 08:56:56 1990  Doug Lea  (dl at g.oswego.edu)

        * RNG.cc: `volatile' added for vars that might have
        greater precision in FP hardware than in memory, to
        force comparisons to be done with memory versions, 
        thus avoiding rounding error.

        * Incorporated patches for graph from rich@rice.edu

        * CHMap.hP: Fixed ifdef name to match class name for <T><C>CHNode

        * istream.h: ctor istream(int filedesc, char* buf, int buflen, 
          int sk, ostream* t = 0) -- made sk non-default to

        * Makefiles: rearrangements, patches from Ron Guillmette
        to enable compiles of etc and gperf files without install

        * Added swap.h, from Ron Guilmette. Apparently needed for
        Hansen's C++ answer book code.

        * ostream.h: added ostream << (const void * p) to print p in hex.

        similarly with strclass.h

Thu Jun  7 08:23:10 1990  Doug Lea  (dl at g.oswego.edu)

          are no longer supported in g++.

        * (everywhere) added support for #pragma interface
        and #pragma implementation; undid .il files since these
        will be done via same mecahnism in g++.
