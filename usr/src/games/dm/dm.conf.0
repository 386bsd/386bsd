     The dm.conf file is the configuration file for the dm(8) program.  It
     consists of lines beginning with one of three keywords, ``badtty'',
     ``game'', and ``time''.  All other lines are ignored.

     Any tty listed after the keyword ``badtty'' may not have games played on
     it.  Entries consist of two white-space separated fields: the string
     ``badtty'' and the ttyname as returned by ttyname(3).  For example, to
     keep the uucp dialout, ``tty19'', from being used for games, the entry
     would be:

           badtty  /dev/tty19

     Any day/hour combination listed after the keyword ``time'' will disallow
     games during those hours.  Entries consist of four white-space separated
     fields: the string ``time'', the unabbreviated day of the week and the
     beginning and ending time of a period of the day when games may not be
     played.  The time fields are in a 0 based, 24-hour clock.  For example,
     the following entry allows games playing before 8AM and after 5PM on Mon-
     days.

           time            Monday  8       17

     Any game listed after the keyword ``game'' will set parameters for a spe-
     cific game.  Entries consist of five white-space separated fields: the
     keyword ``game'', the name of a game, the highest system load average at
     which the game may be played, the maximum users allowed if the game is to
     be played, and the priority at which the game is to be run.  Any of these
     fields may start with a non-numeric character, resulting in no game limi-
     tation or priority based on that field.  The game "default" controls the
     settings for any game not otherwise listed, and must be the last ``game''
     entry in the file.  Priorities may not be negative.  For example, the
     following entries limits the game ``hack'' to running only when the sys-
     tem has 10 or less users and a load average of 5 or less; all other games
     may be run any time the system has 15 or less users.

           game            hack            5       10      *
           game            default *       15      *
