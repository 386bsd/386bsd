Many people and firms have provided hardware and/or money to
try and keep this unfunded project going despite a recession
and hard times -- usually by digging into their own pockets.
Each  of  these	contributors  gave,  not  only because they
believed that the continuation of 386BSD  is  vital  to	the
health of the research, educational, and development commun-
ities, but also because they realize that an individual	can
and does make a difference!

Without the help of the people	listed	here,  this  release
would  simply  not  have  been possible. We would especially
like to thank Thos Sumner, whose loan of a  486/50  SCSI  PC
made  development  go  more rapidly.  The rest of the 386BSD
user community should make special note of all these  people
and   firms  and  commend  them	for  their  generosity	and
foresight.

We hope that their leadership and vision will serve as shin-
ing  examples to the entire 386BSD user community, and serve
to encourage others to actively participate in 386BSD.

The following people have contributed key software programs,
modules and fixes, including novel work and ports of popular
public domain user programs.   Some  of	this  software	was
directly  contributed  to  us,	while  other items were made
available to  all  users  via  the  network.   Occasionally,
several	people	came  up with a variety of approaches for a
single item. In this instance, we tried to  choose  the	one
which  we  felt would best serve the rest of the 386BSD user
base for this release. However, the creativity and persever-
ance  of all the software contributors trying to make 386BSD
better for the entire 386BSD user  community  was  consider-
able. Each individual effort is worthy of pride.

We wish to personally thank all of  these  people,  as	they
have  helped make 386BSD Release 0.1 a reality. We hope that
these contributors and all the rest of the 386BSD user	com-
munity	will continue to actively participate to make future
releases even better!

Many people have continually encouraged us over	the  course
of these releases, and provided us with technical advice and
guidance. These people have also spent considerable time and
energy	getting	this software out to the rest of the 386BSD
community.  While it is impossible for us to  list  everyone
who  has  been	supportive  of 386BSD, we wish to personally
thank some of the people who have been of special assistance
to  us	directly  over	the course of getting 386BSD out the
door.
