_W_h_a_t _i_s _C_a_r_e_w_a_r_e?

     For several years now, the editors of _D_r. _D_o_b_b_s _J_o_u_r_n_a_l
have  overseen a charity program called _C_a_r_e_w_a_r_e.  Careware,
in a nutshell, is a way to "give back"	something  to  those
less  fortunate	in  our  community,  and, at the same time,
obtain a copy of a popular piece of software featured in the
magazine  --  simply  by  stuffing  a  dollar or two in your
floppy mailer for a local charity! It's that easy.

     Now, as part of the DDJ Careware Program, we are making
available  to  the  editors of DDJ the latest version of our
"Tiny 386BSD" installation floppy. Even though we have	made
this  software	freely	available  --  with  no contribution
required for the use of 386BSD -- we hope  that	the  386BSD
User  Community	will  choose to participate in this charity
drive and help the children aided by the _C_h_i_l_d_r_e_n'_s  _S_u_p_p_o_r_t
_L_e_a_g_u_e _o_f _t_h_e _E_a_s_t _B_a_y.

     In this age of "fiscal austerity", many small community
organizations  --  especially those working with children --
have been hard-hit by state and local budget cuts.  The	CSL
is  a  volunteer  organization	which is solely dedicated to
raising funds for small	local	agencies  which	help  needy
children.  Some	of  the  agencies which have received funds
from CSL in the past include those using computers  to	com-
municate  with disabled children, providing respite weekends
for abused children, counciling bereaved children, and	set-
ting  up  safe after-school play areas for children in impo-
verished neighborhoods.

     Simply put, by sending a dollar or two along with	your
software  request,  you directly benefit a child. Even if it
is only a dollar, it does make a difference.

     To get a labeled copy of "Tiny 386BSD",  send  a  high-
density	error-free  formatted	floppy	(either	3.5-inch or
5.25-inch) and a SASE mailer to:

While there is no obligation to participate,  if  you  would
like to help a disadvantaged child, just include a dollar or
two (or more, if you so desire) in  your  mailer  and  we'll
make sure it gets to the Children's Support League.  (If you
send a check, please make it payable to the "Children's Sup-
port League of the East Bay").

     Thanks to the generous and enthusiastic response of the
D-Flat	C-library  users and and X-Sharp 3-D Graphics users,
the DDJ Careware  Project  has	helped	hundreds  of  people
throughout the country.

     While a dollar or two may seem like a  trivial  amount,
it does add up.	The Brevard County Food Bank in Florida has
received over $3,000 in the past year alone from  supportive
users  of  D-Flat, and the Vermont Association for the Blind
and Visually Disabled has received over	$100  in  the	past
month  from  X-Sharp users. For these charities, a dollar or
two has made a difference!

     Now it's our turn. Just like the generous users  of  D-
Flat  and X-Sharp, we believe that each person in the 386BSD
User Community is quite willing to meet	the  challenge	and
help  a	child.	We  know  that a dollar or two from 386BSD
users can make a difference as well.  The  choice,  however,
is yours.
