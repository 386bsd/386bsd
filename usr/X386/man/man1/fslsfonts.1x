fslsfonts - server font list displayer for X font server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fslsfonts
[-options ...] [-fn pattern]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fslsfonts
lists the fonts that match the given \fIpattern\fP.
The wildcard character "*" may be used to match any sequence of
characters (including none), and "?" to match any single character.
If no pattern is given, "*" is assumed.

The "*" and "?" characters must be quoted to prevent them from
being expanded by the shell.

.B \-m
This option indicates that long listings should also print the minimum and
maximum bounds of each font.

This option indicates that listings should use multiple columns.  This is the
same as \fB-n 0\fP.

same as \fB-n 1\fP.
.TP 8

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.SH BUGS
Doing ``fslsfonts -l'' can tie up your server for a very long time.
This is really a bug with single-threaded non-preemptable servers, not with
this program.
