                    Readme for the Xfree86 2.0 LinkKit
                    ----------------------------------

0. For systems which don't use gcc-2, you may need to install libgcc.a if
   the binary distribution you are using was built with gcc-2.

1. Edit the site.def file to define which servers you want to build, and
   the drivers and font renderers you want included.

    - Set HasGcc and HasGcc2 to match the compiler you are using if
      the defaults aren't correct.
    - If the linkkit was built with gcc-2.x and you are using some other
      compiler, you must install libgcc.a and set NeedLibGcc to YES.

    - To build the 256 colour server, set XF86SVGAServer to YES.
    - To build the 256 colour server:   set XF86SVGAServer to YES.
    - To build the 16 colour server:    set XF86VGA16Server to YES.
    - To build the monochrome server:   set XF86MonoServer to YES.
    - To build the S3 server:           set XF86S3Server to YES.
    - To build the Mach8 server:        set XF86Mach8Server to YES.
    - To build the Mach32 server:       set XF86Mach32Server to YES.
    - To build the IBM 8514/A server:   set XF86I8514Server to YES.

    - Set X386Vga256Drivers to the list of drivers you want to include in
      the 256 colour server.
    - Set X386Vga16Drivers to the list of drivers you want to include in
      the 16 colour server.
    - Set X386Vga2Drivers to the list of drivers you want to include in the
      monochrome vga server.  The vga2 driver can be disabled by defining
      this list to be empty.
    - Set X386Hga2Drivers to hga6845 to enable the hga2 driver in the
      monochrome server. The hga2 driver can be disabled by defining this
      to be empty.
    - Set X386Bdm2Drivers to hgc1280 to enable the Hyundai bdm2 driver in
      the monochrome server. The bdm2 driver can be disabled by defining
      this to be empty.
    - Set XF86S3Drivers to the list of drivers you want to include in the
      S3 server.
    - Set FontRenderers to the list of font renderers you want to include
      in the server.

   Note: the ordering of drivers determines the order in which the probing
   is done.  The 'generic' driver should be the last one included in the
   monochrome and 16 colour servers because its probe always succeeds.  The
   'generic_s3' driver should be the last one included in the S3 servers
   for similar reasons.

2. If you are including a driver that it not part of the standard
   distribution, make a directory in drivers/vga256 (drivers/vga2 if it is
   for the monochrome server, drivers/vga16 if it is for the 16 colour
   server, or drivers/bdm2 if it is for the bdm2 monochrome server's bdm2
   screen) and copy either the source or .o file and a suitable Imakefile
   into that directory.  The name of the directory should be the same as
   the name of the driver (refer to the documentation in the VGADriverDoc
   directory for more details).  If you are adding an additional font
   renderer, put the library in renderers/.

3. To build the Makefile, run

     ./mkmf

4. Run 'make' to link the server(s) as configured.

5. Run 'make install' to install the new server(s).

6. Run 'make clean' to remove the files that were created by this
   procedure.

7. It is possible to see which drivers are included in the server by
   running it with the '-showconfig' flag.
