     The ccuutt utility selects portions of each line (as specified by _l_i_s_t) from
     each _f_i_l_e (or the standard input by default), and writes them to the
     standard output.  The items specified by _l_i_s_t can be in terms of column
     position or in terms of fields delimited by a special character. Column
     numbering starts from 1.

     _L_i_s_t is a comma or whitespace separated set of increasing numbers and/or
     number ranges.  Number ranges consist of a number, a dash (-), and a sec-
     ond number and select the fields or columns from the first number to the
     second, inclusive.  Numbers or number ranges may be preceded by a dash,
     which selects all fields or columns from 1 to the first number.  Numbers
     or number ranges may be followed by a dash, which selects all fields or
     columns from the last number to the end of the line.  Numbers and number
     ranges may be repeated, overlapping, and in any order.  It is not an er-
     ror to select fields or columns not present in the input line.

     The options are as follows:

     --cc _l_i_s_t     The _l_i_s_t specifies character positions.

     --dd _s_t_r_i_n_g   Use _c_h_a_r as the field delimiter character instead of the tab
                 character.

     --ff _l_i_s_t     The _l_i_s_t specifies fields, delimited in the input by a single
                 tab character.  Output fields are separated by a single tab
                 character.

     --ss          Suppresses lines with no field delimiter characters.  Unless
                 specified, lines with no delimiters are passed through unmod-
                 ified.

     CCuutt exits 0 on success, 1 if an error occurred.
