     SShhaarr writes an sh(1) shell script to the standard output which will
     recreate the file hierarchy specified by the command line operands.  Di-
     rectories will be recreated and must be specified before the files they
     contain.

     SShhaarr is normally used for distributing small numbers of files by ftp(1)
     or mail(1).

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     compress(1),  mail(1),  uuencode(1),  tar(1)

BBUUGGSS
     SShhaarr makes no provisions for special types of files or files containing
     magic characters.

     It is easy to insert trojan horses into sshhaarr files.  It is strongly rec-
     ommended that all shell archive files be examined before running them
     through sh(1).  Archives produced using this implementation of sshhaarr may
     be easily examined with the command:

           grep -v '^X' program.shar

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     To create a shell archive of the program ls(1) and mail it to Rick:

           cd ls
           shar `find . -print`  mail -s "ls source" rick

     To recreate the program directory:

           mkdir ls
           cd ls
           <delete header lines and examine mailed archive>
           sh archive
