     BBiiffff informs the system whether you want to be notified when mail arrives
     during the current terminal session.

     Options supported by bbiiffff:

     nn     Disables notification.

     yy     Enables notification.

     When mail notification is enabled, the header and first few lines of the
     message will be printed on your screen whenever mail arrives.  A ``biff
     y'' command is often included in the file ._l_o_g_i_n or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e to be exe-
     cuted at each login.

     BBiiffff operates asynchronously.  For synchronous notification use the _M_A_I_L
     variable of sh(1) or the _m_a_i_l variable of csh(1).
