     The utility mmttrreeee compares a directory hierarchy against a specification
     for a directory hierarchy.  By default, the specification is read from
     the standard input.  MMttrreeee verifies that the tree rooted in the current
     directory matches the specification.

     Messages are written to standard output for any files whose characteris-
     tics do not match those of the specification, or which are missing from
     either the specification or the tree.

     The options are as follows:

     --cc    Print a specification for the tree to standard output.

     --dd    Ignore everything except directory type files.

     --ee    Don't object to files that are in the tree but not in the specifi-
           cation.

     --ff    Read the specification from _f_i_l_e, instead of from standard input.

     --pp    Traverse the tree rooted in _p_a_t_h, instead of the current directory.

     --rr    Remove any files in the tree that are not described in the specifi-
           cation.

     --uu    Modify the owner, group, and permissions of existing files to match
           the specification, as well as create any missing directories.  Own-
           er, group, and permissions must all be specified for missing direc-
           tories to be created.

     --xx    Don't descend below any mount points.

     Specifications are mostly composed of ``keywords'', i.e. strings that
     that specify values relating to files.  No keywords have default values,
     and if a keyword has no set value no checks based on it are performed.

     Currently supported keywords are as follows:

     cckkssuumm       The checksum of the file using the algorithm specified by the
                 program cksum(1).

     iiggnnoorree      Causes the hierarchy below the file to be ignored.

     ggrroouupp       The group of the file; may be either numeric or symbolic.

     mmooddee        The current file's permissions as an absolute (octal) or sym-
                 bolic value (see chmod(1)).

     nnlliinnkk       The number of hard links the file is expected to have.

     oowwnneerr       The owner of the file; may be either numeric or symbolic.

     ssiizzee        The size, in bytes, of the file.



     lliinnkk        The file a symbolic link is expected to reference.

     ttiimmee        The last modification time of the file.

     ttyyppee        The type of the file; may be set to any one of the following:
                 bblloocckk       block special device
                 cchhaarr        character special device
                 ddiirr         directory
                 ffiiffoo        fifo
                 ffiillee        regular file
                 lliinnkk        symbolic link
                 ssoocckkeett      socket

     There are four types of lines in a specification.

     The first type of line sets a ``global'' value for a keyword, and con-
     sists of a leading ``/set'' followed by whitespace, followed by sets of
     keyword/value pairs, separated by whitespace.  Keyword/value pairs con-
     sist of a keyword, followed by a equals sign (``=''), followed by a val-
     ue, without intervening whitespace.  Once a keyword has been set, its
     value remains unchanged until either set again or unset.

     The second type of line unsets keywords and consists of a leading ``/un-
     set'', followed by whitespace, followed by one or more keywords, separat-
     ed by whitespace.

     The third type of line is a file specification and consists of a file
     name, followed by whitespace, followed by zero or more whitespace sepa-
     rated keyword/value pairs.  The file name may be preceded by any number
     of whitespace characters.  The file name may contain any of the standard
     file name matching characters (``['', ``]'', ``?'' or ``*''), in which
     case files in the hierarchy will be associated with the first pattern
     that they match.

     Each of the keyword/value pairs consist of a keyword, followed by an
     equals sign (``=''), followed by the keyword's value, without intervening
     whitespace.  These values override, without changing, the global value of
     the corresponding keyword.

     All paths are relative.  Specifying a directory will cause subsequent
     files to be searched for in that directory hierarchy.  Which brings us to
     the last type of line in a specification: a line containing only the
     string ``....'' causes the current directory path to ascend one level.

     Empty lines and lines whose first non-whitespace character is a hash mark
     (``#'') are ignored.

     MMttrreeee exits with a status of 0 on success and >0 if an error occurred or
     the tree did not match the specification.

     The cckkssuumm keyword is not yet implemented.

     The ttiimmee keyword should be specifiable in human readable terms.
