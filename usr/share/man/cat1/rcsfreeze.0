       The _r_c_s_f_r_e_e_z_e command has the purpose of assigning a  sym-
       bolic  revision number to a set of RCS files, which form a
       valid configuration.

       The idea is to run _r_c_s_f_r_e_e_z_e each time a  new  version  is
       checked  in.  A unique symbolic revision number (CC___n_u_m_b_e_r,
       where _n_u_m_b_e_r is increased each time rcsfreeze is  run)  is
       then assigned to the most recent revision of each RCS file
       of the main trunk.

       If the command is invoked  with  an  argument,  then  this
       argument is used as the symbolic name to freeze a configu-
       ration.  The unique identifier is still generated  and  is
       listed  in  the log file but it will not appear as part of
       the symbolic revision name in the actual RCS files.

       A log message is requested from the user  which  is  saved
       for future references.

       The  shell script works only on all RCS files at one time.
       It is important that all  changed  files  are  checked  in
       (there  are  no  precautions  against  any  error  in this
       respect). Run  _r_c_s_c_l_e_a_n(1L)  first  and  see  whether  any
       sources remain in the current directory.

       checked out and modified.
