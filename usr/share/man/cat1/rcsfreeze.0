       rcsfreeze  -  freeze a configuration of sources checked in

       The _r_c_s_f_r_e_e_z_e command  has  the  purpose  of  assigning  a
       symbolic revision number to a set of RCS files, which form
       a valid configuration.

       The idea is to run _r_c_s_f_r_e_e_z_e each time a  new  version  is
       checked  in.  A unique symbolic revision number (CC___n_u_m_b_e_r,
       where _n_u_m_b_e_r is increased each time rcsfreeze is  run)  is
       then assigned to the most recent revision of each RCS file
       of the main trunk.

       If the command is invoked  with  an  argument,  then  this
       argument  is  used  as  the  symbolic  name  to  freeze  a
       configuration.  The unique identifier is  still  generated
       and  is  listed  in the log file but it will not appear as
       part of the symbolic  revision  name  in  the  actual  RCS
       files.

       A  log  message  is requested from the user which is saved
       for future references.

       The shell script works only on all RCS files at one  time.
       It  is  important  that  all  changed files are checked in
       (there are  no  precautions  against  any  error  in  this
       respect).  Run  _r_c_s_c_l_e_a_n(1L)  first  and  see  whether any
       sources remain in the current directory.

       checked out and modified.
