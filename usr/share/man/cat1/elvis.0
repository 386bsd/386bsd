       _E_l_v_i_s is a text editor which emulates _v_i/_e_x.

       On  systems  which  pass  the program name as an argument,
       such as Unix and Minix, you may also install  _e_l_v_i_s  under
       the  names  "ex",  "vi", "view", and "input".  These extra
       names would normally be links to elvis; see the "ln" shell
       command.

       When  _e_l_v_i_s  is  invoked  as  "vi",  it behaves exactly as
       though it was invoked as "elvis".  However, if you  invoke
       _e_l_v_i_s as "view", then the readonly option is set as though
       you had given it the "-R" flag.  If you  invoke  _e_l_v_i_s  as
       "ex",  then  _e_l_v_i_s will start up in the colon command mode
       instead of the visual command  mode,  as  though  you  had
       given it the "-e" flag.  If you invoke _e_l_v_i_s as "input" or
       "edit", then _e_l_v_i_s will start up in input mode, as  though
       the "-i" flag was given.

       --rr     To  the  real  vi,  this flag means that a previous
              edit should be recovered.   _E_l_v_i_s,  though,  has  a
              separate  program, called _e_l_v_r_e_c(_1), for recovering
              files.  When you invoke _e_l_v_i_s with -r,  _e_l_v_i_s  will
              tell you to run _e_l_v_r_e_c.

       --RR     This sets the "readonly" option, so you won't acci-
              dentally overwrite a file.

       --tt _t_a_g This causes _e_l_v_i_s to start  editing  at  the  given
              tag.

       --mm [_f_i_l_e]
              _E_l_v_i_s  will  search through _f_i_l_e for something that
              looks like an error message from  a  compiler.   It
              will then begin editing the source file that caused
              the error, with the  cursor  sitting  on  the  line
              where the error was detected.  If you don't explic-
              itly name a _f_i_l_e, then "errlist" is assumed.

       --ee     _E_l_v_i_s will start up in colon command mode.

       --vv     _E_l_v_i_s will start up in visual command mode.

       --ii     _E_l_v_i_s will start up in input mode.

       --ww _w_i_n_s_i_z_e
              Sets the "window" option's value to _w_i_n_s_i_z_e.

       ++_c_o_m_m_a_n_d or --cc _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
              If you use the +_c_o_m_m_a_n_d parameter, then  after  the
              first  file  is loaded _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is executed as an EX
              command.  A typical example would  be  "elvis  +237
              foo",  which would cause _e_l_v_i_s to start editing foo
              and then move directly to line 237.  The  "-c  _c_o_m-
              _m_a_n_d"  variant  was added for UNIX SysV compatibil-
              ity.

FFIILLEESS
       /tmp/elv*
              During editing, _e_l_v_i_s stores text  in  a  temporary
              file.   For  UNIX, this file will usually be stored
              in the /tmp directory, and the first three  charac-
              ters  will be "elv".  For other systems, the tempo-
              rary files may be stored someplace  else;  see  the
              version-specific section of the documentation.

       tags   This  is the database used by the :_t_a_g_s command and
              the --tt  option.   It  is  usually  created  by  the
              _c_t_a_g_s(_1) program.

       .exrc or elvis.rc
              On UNIX-like systems, a file called ".exrc" in your
              home directory is executed as a series of  _e_x  com-
              mands.   A file by the same name may be executed in
              the current directory, too.  On  non-UNIX  systems,
              ".exrc" is usually an invalid file name; there, the
              initialization file is called "elvis.rc" instead.

BBUUGGSS
       There  is  no  LISP  support.   Certain other features are
       missing, too.

       Auto-indent mode is not quite compatible with the real vi.
       Among  other  things,  0^D and ^^D don't do what you might
       expect.

       Long lines are displayed differently.  The real  vi  wraps
       long  lines  onto  multiple  rows of the screen, but _e_l_v_i_s
       scrolls sideways.

       Many other people have worked to  port  _e_l_v_i_s  to  various
       operating  systems.   To  see who deserves credit, run the
