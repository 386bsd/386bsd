       _E_l_v_i_s is a text editor which emulates _v_i/_e_x.

       On  systems  which  pass  the program name as an argument,
       such as Unix and Minix, you may also install  _e_l_v_i_s  under
       the  names  "ex",  "vi", "view", and "input".  These extra
       names would normally be links to elvis; see the "ln" shell
       command.

       When  _e_l_v_i_s  is  invoked  as  "vi",  it behaves exactly as
       though it was invoked as "elvis".  However, if you  invoke
       _e_l_v_i_s as "view", then the readonly option is set as though
       you had given it the "-R" flag.  If you  invoke  _e_l_v_i_s  as
       "ex",  then  _e_l_v_i_s will start up in the colon command mode
       instead of the visual command  mode,  as  though  you  had
       given it the "-e" flag.  If you invoke _e_l_v_i_s as "input" or
       "edit", then _e_l_v_i_s will start up in input mode, as  though
       the "-i" flag was given.

       --rr     To  the  real  vi,  this flag means that a previous
              edit should be recovered.   _E_l_v_i_s,  though,  has  a
              separate  program, called _e_l_v_r_e_c(_1), for recovering
              files.  When you invoke _e_l_v_i_s with -r,  _e_l_v_i_s  will
              tell you to run _e_l_v_r_e_c.

       --RR     This  sets  the  "readonly"  option,  so  you won't
              accidentally overwrite a file.

       --tt _t_a_g This causes _e_l_v_i_s to start  editing  at  the  given
              tag.

       --mm [_f_i_l_e]
              _E_l_v_i_s  will  search through _f_i_l_e for something that
              looks like an error message from  a  compiler.   It
              will then begin editing the source file that caused
              the error, with the  cursor  sitting  on  the  line
              where   the  error  was  detected.   If  you  don't
              explicitly name a _f_i_l_e, then "errlist" is  assumed.

       --ee     _E_l_v_i_s will start up in colon command mode.

       --vv     _E_l_v_i_s will start up in visual command mode.

       --ii     _E_l_v_i_s will start up in input mode.

       --ww _w_i_n_s_i_z_e
              Sets the "window" option's value to _w_i_n_s_i_z_e.

              If  you  use the +_c_o_m_m_a_n_d parameter, then after the
              first file is loaded _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is executed as  an  EX
              command.   A  typical  example would be "elvis +237
              foo", which would cause _e_l_v_i_s to start editing  foo
              and  then  move  directly  to  line  237.   The "-c
              _c_o_m_m_a_n_d"  variant   was   added   for   UNIX   SysV
              compatibility.

FFIILLEESS
       /tmp/elv*
              During  editing,  _e_l_v_i_s  stores text in a temporary
              file.  For UNIX, this file will usually  be  stored
              in   the   /tmp  directory,  and  the  first  three
              characters will be "elv".  For other  systems,  the
              temporary  files  may be stored someplace else; see
              the version-specific section of the  documentation.

       tags   This  is the database used by the :_t_a_g_s command and
              the --tt  option.   It  is  usually  created  by  the
              _c_t_a_g_s(_1) program.

       .exrc or elvis.rc
              On UNIX-like systems, a file called ".exrc" in your
              home directory  is  executed  as  a  series  of  _e_x
              commands.   A file by the same name may be executed
              in  the  current  directory,  too.    On   non-UNIX
              systems,  ".exrc"  is usually an invalid file name;
              there, the initialization file is called "elvis.rc"
              instead.

BBUUGGSS
       There is no LISP  support.   Certain  other  features  are
       missing, too.

       Auto-indent mode is not quite compatible with the real vi.
       Among other things, 0^D and ^^D don't do  what  you  might
       expect.

       Long  lines  are displayed differently.  The real vi wraps
       long lines onto multiple rows of  the  screen,  but  _e_l_v_i_s
       scrolls sideways.
