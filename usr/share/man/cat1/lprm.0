     llpprrmm - remove jobs from the line printer spooling queue

     llpprrmm [--PP_p_r_i_n_t_e_r] [--] [job # ...] [_u_s_e_r ...]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     LLpprrmm will remove a job, or jobs, from a printer's spool queue.  Since the
     spooling directory is protected from users, using llpprrmm is normally the
     only method by which a user may remove a job.  The owner of a job is de-
     termined by the user's login name and host name on the machine where the
     lpr(1) command was invoked.

     Options and arguments:

     --PP_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
             Specify the queue associated with a specific _p_r_i_n_t_e_r (otherwise
             the default printer is used).

     --       If a single `--' is given, llpprrmm will remove all jobs which a user
             owns.  If the super-user employs this flag, the spool queue will
             be emptied entirely.

     _u_s_e_r    Causes llpprrmm to attempt to remove any jobs queued belonging to
             that user (or users).  This form of invoking llpprrmm is useful only
             to the super-user.

     _j_o_b #   A user may dequeue an individual job by specifying its job num-
             ber.  This number may be obtained from the lpq(1) program, e.g.

                   % lpq -l

                   1st:ken                         [job #013ucbarpa]
                           (standard input)        100 bytes
                   % lprm 13

     If neither arguments or options are given, LLpprrmm will delete the currently
     active job if it is owned by the user who invoked llpprrmm.

     LLpprrmm announces the names of any files it removes and is silent if there
     are no jobs in the queue which match the request list.

     LLpprrmm will kill off an active daemon, if necessary, before removing any
     spooling files.  If a daemon is killed, a new one is automatically
     restarted upon completion of file removals.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     If the following environment variable exists, it is utilized by llpprrmm.

     PRINTER  If the environment variable PRINTER exists, and a printer has
              not been specified with the --PP option, the default printer is
              assumed from PRINTER.

FFIILLEESS
     /etc/printcap       Printer characteristics file.
     /var/spool/*        Spooling directories.
     /var/spool/*/lock   Lock file used to obtain the pid of the current dae-
                         mon and the job number of the currently active job.

     ``Permission denied" if the user tries to remove files other than his
     own.

BBUUGGSS
     Since there are race conditions possible in the update of the lock file,
     the currently active job may be incorrectly identified.

     The llpprrmm command appeared in 3.0BSD.
