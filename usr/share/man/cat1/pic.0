DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ggppiicc  compiles  descriptions  of  pictures embedded within
       ttrrooffff or TeX input files into commands that are understood
       by  TeX  or ttrrooffff.  Each picture starts with a line begin-
       ning with ..PPSS and ends with a  line  beginning  with  ..PPEE.
       Anything  outside of ..PPSS and ..PPEE is passed through without
       change.

       It is the user's  responsibility  to  provide  appropriate
       definitions of the PPSS and PPEE macros.  When the macro pack-
       age being used does not supply such definitions (for exam-
       ple,  old versions of -ms), appropriate definitions can be
       obtained with --mmppiicc: these will center each picture.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Options that do not take arguments may be grouped behind a
       single  --.   The special option ---- can be used to mark the
       end of the options.  A filename of -- refers to  the  stan-
       dard input.

       --CC     Recognize ..PPSS and ..PPEE even when followed by a char-
              acter other than space or newline.

       --pp     Grops mode.  Use this if the output of gpic will be
              processed  by  ggttrrooffff and ggrrooppss.  In this mode gpic
              can make use the  \\XX''ppss:: _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g''  command.   Cur-
              rently it does this only for the aalliiggnneedd attribute.

       --tt     TeX mode.

       --cc     Be more compatible with ttppiicc.  Implies  --tt.   Lines
              beginning  with  \\ are not passed through transpar-
              ently.  Lines beginning with ..  are passed  through
              with the initial ..  changed to \\.  A line beginning
              with ..ppss is given special treatment:  it  takes  an
              optional   integer  argument  specifying  the  line
              thickness (pen  size)  in  milliinches;  a  missing
              argument  restores the previous line thickness; the
              default line thickness is 8 milliinches.  The  line
              thickness  thus  specified takes effect only when a
              non-negative line thickness has not been  specified
              by use of the tthhiicckknneessss attribute or by setting the
              lliinneetthhiicckk variable.

              extensions  to the standard troff drawing commands.
              These are described in ggrrooffff__oouutt(@MAN5EXT@).  These
              extensions  can  be  used  with  device-independent
              troff, provided that the version being used  passes
              through  unrecognised drawing commands in the stan-
              dard way.  This implies --zz.

       --zz     Draw dots using zero-length lines. This applies  to
              both TeX mode and ttrrooffff mode.

       The  following  options supported by other versions of ppiicc
       are ignored:

       --DD     Draw all lines using the \D escape  sequence.   ppiicc
              always does this.

       --TT _d_e_v Generate  output for the ttrrooffff device _d_e_v.  This is
              unnecessary because the ttrrooffff output  generated  by
              ppiicc is device-independent.

UUSSAAGGEE
       This  section  describes only the differences between gpic
       and the original pic.   Many  of  these  differences  also
       apply to newer versions of pic.

   TTeeXX mmooddee
       TeX  mode  is enabled by the --tt option.  In TeX mode, gpic
       will define a vbox called \\ggrraapphh for  each  picture.   You
       must yourself print that vbox using, for example, the com-
       mand

              \\cceenntteerrlliinnee{{\\bbooxx\\ggrraapphh}}

       Actually, since the vbox has a height of  zero  this  will
       produce  slightly  more  vertical  space above the picture
       than below it;

              \\cceenntteerrlliinnee{{\\rraaiissee 11eemm\\bbooxx\\ggrraapphh}}

       would avoid this.

       You must use a TeX driver that supports the ttppiicc specials,
       version 2.

       Lines beginning with \\ are passed through transparently; a
       %% is added to the  end  of  the  line  to  avoid  unwanted
       spaces.   You  can safely use this feature to change fonts
       or to change the value of  \\bbaasseelliinneesskkiipp.   Anything  else
       may  well  produce  undesirable  results;  use at your own
       risk.  Lines beginning with a period  are  not  given  any
       special treatment.

              The commands to be performed for each line can also
              be taken from a macro defined earlier by giving the
              name of the macro as the argument to tthhrruu.

              given, reset all  pre-defined  variables  to  their
              default  values.   Note  that  assigning a value to
              ssccaallee also causes all  pre-defined  variables  that
              control  dimensions  to  be  reset to their default
              values times the new value of scale.

              This is a text object which is constructed by using
              _t_e_x_t  as  a format string for sprintf with an argu-
              ment of _e_x_p_r.  If _t_e_x_t is omitted a  format  string
              of  ""%%gg""  is  used.  Attributes can be specified in
              the same way as for a normal text object.  Be  very
              careful  that  you  specify  an  appropriate format
              string; gpic does only very limited checking of the
              string.  This is deprecated in favour of sspprriinnttff.

       Arguments of the form

              _X anything _X

       are also allowed to be of the form

              {{ _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g }}

       In  this case _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g can contain balanced occurrences of
       {{ and }}.  Strings may contain _X or imbalanced  occurrences
       of {{ and }}.

   OOtthheerr CChhaannggeess
       A bare expression, _e_x_p_r, is acceptable as an attribute; it
       is equivalent to _d_i_r _e_x_p_r, where _d_i_r is the current direc-
       tion.  For example

              lliinnee 22ii

       means  draw a line 2 inches long in the current direction.

       The maximum width and height of the picture are taken from
       the  variables mmaaxxppsswwiidd and mmaaxxppsshhtt.  Initially these have
       values 8.5 and 11.

       Scientific notation is allowed for numbers.  For example
              xx == 55ee--22

       Text attributes can be compounded.  For example,
              ""ffoooo"" aabboovvee lljjuusstt
       is legal.

       There is no limit to the depth  to  which  blocks  can  be
       examined.  For example,
              [[AA:: [[BB:: [[CC:: bbooxx ]]]]]] wwiitthh ..AA..BB..CC..ssww aatt 11,,22
              cciirrccllee aatt llaasstt [[]]..AA..BB..CC
       is acceptable.

       Arcs  now  have compass points determined by the circle of
       which the arc is a part.

       Circles and arcs can be dotted or  dashed.   In  TeX  mode
       splines can be dotted or dashed.

       Boxes  can have rounded corners.  The rraadd attribute speci-
       fies the radius of the quarter-circles at each corner.  If
       no  rraadd  or ddiiaamm attribute is given, a radius of bbooxxrraadd is
       used.  Initially, bbooxxrraadd has a value of  0.   A  box  with
       rounded corners can be dotted or dashed.

       The ..PPSS line can have a second argument specifying a maxi-
       mum height for the picture.  If the width of zero is spec-
       ified  the  width will be ignored in computing the scaling

       factor for the picture.  Note that gpic will always  scale
       a  picture  by the same amount vertically as horizontally.
       This is different from the DWB 2.0 pic which may  scale  a
       picture by a different amount vertically than horizontally
       if a height is specified.

       Each text object has an invisible box associated with  it.
       The compass points of a text object are determined by this
       box.  The implicit motion associated with  the  object  is
       also  determined  by this box.  The dimensions of this box
       are taken from the width and  height  attributes;  if  the
       width  attribute  is  not  supplied then the width will be
       taken to be tteexxttwwiidd; if the height attribute is  not  sup-
       plied  then  the  height will be taken to be the number of
       text strings associated  with  the  object  times  tteexxtthhtt.
       Initially tteexxttwwiidd and tteexxtthhtt have a value of 0.

       In  places  where  a  quoted  text  string can be used, an
       expression of the form

              sspprriinnttff((""_f_o_r_m_a_t"",, aarrgg,......)

       can also be used; this will produce the arguments  format-
       ted  according  to  _f_o_r_m_a_t,  which  should  be a string as
       described in pprriinnttff(3) appropriate for the number of argu-
       ments supplied, using only the ee, ff, gg or %% format charac-
       ters.

       The thickness of the lines used to draw  objects  is  con-
       trolled  by the lliinneetthhiicckk variable.  This gives the thick-
       ness of lines in points.  A negative value means  use  the
       default  thickness:  in  TeX output mode, this means use a
       thickness of 8 milliinches; in TeX output mode with the --cc
       option, this means use the line thickness specified by ..ppss
       lines; in troff output mode, this means  use  a  thickness
       proportional  to  the  pointsize.  A zero value means draw
       the thinnest possible line supported by the output device.
       Initially  it  has  a  value  of  -1.   There  is  also  a
       tthhiicckk[nneessss] attribute.  For example,

              cciirrccllee tthhiicckknneessss 11..55

       would draw a circle using a line with a thickness  of  1.5
       points.   The  thickness  of  lines is not affected by the
       value of the ssccaallee variable, nor by the  width  or  height
       given in the ..PPSS line.

       Boxes  (including boxes with rounded corners), circles and
       ellipses can be filled by  giving  then  an  attribute  of
       ffiillll[eedd].   This  takes an optional argument of an expres-
       sion with a value between 0 and 1; 0  will  fill  it  with
       white,  1 with black, values in between with a proportion-
       ally gray shade.  A value greater than 1 can also be used:
       this  means  fill with the shade of gray that is currently

       being used for text and  lines.   Normally  this  will  be
       black,  but  output  devices  may  provide a mechanism for
       changing this.  Without an argument, then the value of the
       variable ffiillllvvaall will be used.  Initially this has a value
       of 0.5.  The invisible attribute does not affect the fill-
       ing  of objects.  Any text associated with a filled object
       will be added after the object has been  filled,  so  that
       the text will not be obscured by the filling.

       Arrow  heads will be drawn as solid triangles if the vari-
       able aarrrroowwhheeaadd is non-zero and either TeX mode is  enabled
       or  the --xx option has been given.  Initially aarrrroowwhheeaadd has
       a value of 1.

       The troff output of gpic is  device-independent.   The  --TT
       option  is  therefore redundant.  All numbers are taken to
       be in inches; numbers are never interpreted to be in troff
       machine units.

       Objects  can  have  an  aalliiggnneedd  attribute.   This is only
       available with the --pp option.  Any text associated with an
       object  having the aalliiggnneedd attribute will be rotated about
       the center of the object so that  it  is  aligned  in  the
       direction  from  the  start  point to the end point of the
       object.  Note that this attribute will have no effect  for
       objects whose start and end points are coincident.
