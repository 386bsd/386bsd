       _R_c_s  creates  new  RCS  files  or  changes  attributes  of
       existing ones.  An RCS file contains multiple revisions of
       text,  an access list, a change log, descriptive text, and
       some control attributes.  For _r_c_s to  work,  the  caller's
       login  name  must  be  on  the  access list, except if the
       access list is empty, the caller is the owner of the  file
       or the superuser, or the --ii option is present.

       Files ending in `,v' are RCS files, all others are working
       files. If a working file is given, _r_c_s tries to  find  the
       corresponding  RCS  file first in directory ./RCS and then
       in the current directory, as explained in _c_o(1L).

       --ii         creates and initializes a  new  RCS  file,  but
                  does not deposit any revision.  If the RCS file
                  has no path prefix, _r_c_s tries to place it first
                  into  the subdirectory ./RCS, and then into the
                  current directory.  If  the  RCS  file  already
                  exists, an error message is printed.

       --aa_l_o_g_i_n_s   appends the login names appearing in the comma-
                  separated list _l_o_g_i_n_s to the access list of the
                  RCS file.

       --AA_o_l_d_f_i_l_e  appends  the  access  list  of  _o_l_d_f_i_l_e  to the
                  access list of the RCS file.

       --ee[_l_o_g_i_n_s] erases the login names appearing in the  comma-
                  separated  list  _l_o_g_i_n_s from the access list of
                  the RCS file.  If _l_o_g_i_n_s is omitted, the entire
                  access list is erased.

       --bb[_r_e_v]    sets  the  default  branch  to  _r_e_v.  If _r_e_v is
                  omitted, the default branch  is  reset  to  the
                  (dynamically) highest branch on the trunk.

       --cc_s_t_r_i_n_g   sets  the comment leader to _s_t_r_i_n_g. The comment
                  leader is printed before every log message line
                  generated by the keyword $Log$  during checkout
                  (see _c_o(1L)).  This is useful  for  programming
                  languages  without  multi-line comments. During
                  rrccss --ii or initial ccii,  the  comment  leader  is
                  guessed from the suffix of the working file.

       --ll[_r_e_v]    locks  the  revision  with  number  _r_e_v.   If a
                  branch is given, the latest  revision  on  that
                  branch  is  locked.   If  _r_e_v  is  omitted, the

                  latest  revision  on  the  default  branch   is
                  locked.   Locking prevents overlapping changes.
                  A lock is  removed  with  ccii  or  rrccss  --uu  (see
                  below).

       --uu[_r_e_v]    unlocks  the  revision  with  number _r_e_v.  If a
                  branch is given, the latest  revision  on  that
                  branch  is  unlocked.   If  _r_e_v is omitted, the
                  latest lock held  by  the  caller  is  removed.
                  Normally,  only  the  locker  of a revision may
                  unlock it.  Somebody else unlocking a  revision
                  breaks the lock.  This causes a mail message to
                  be sent to the original  locker.   The  message
                  contains   a   commentary  solicited  from  the
                  breaker.  The commentary is terminated  with  a
                  line containing a single `.' or control-D.

       --LL         sets  locking  to  _s_t_r_i_c_t. Strict locking means
                  that the owner of an RCS  file  is  not  exempt
                  from  locking  for checkin.  This option should
                  be used for files that are shared.

       --UU         sets locking to non-strict. Non-strict  locking
                  means  that the owner of a file need not lock a
                  revision for checkin.  This option  should  NOT
                  be used for files that are shared.  The default
                  (--LL  or  --UU)  is  determined  by  your   system
                  administrator.

       --nn_n_a_m_e[:_r_e_v]
                  associates  the  symbolic  name  _n_a_m_e  with the
                  branch or revision _r_e_v.  _R_c_s  prints  an  error
                  message  if  _n_a_m_e  is  already  associated with
                  another  number.   If  _r_e_v  is   omitted,   the
                  symbolic name is deleted.

       --NN_n_a_m_e[:_r_e_v]
                  same as --nn, except that it overrides a previous
                  assignment of _n_a_m_e.

       --oo_r_a_n_g_e    deletes ("outdates")  the  revisions  given  by
                  _r_a_n_g_e.  A range consisting of a single revision
                  number means that revision.  A range consisting
                  of a branch number means the latest revision on
                  that branch.  A range  of  the  form  _r_e_v_1-_r_e_v_2
                  means  revisions  _r_e_v_1  to  _r_e_v_2  on  the  same
                  branch, -_r_e_v means from the  beginning  of  the
                  branch  containing _r_e_v up to and including _r_e_v,
                  and _r_e_v- means from revision _r_e_v to the end  of
                  the   branch   containing  _r_e_v.   None  of  the
                  outdated revisions may have branches or  locks.

       --ss_s_t_a_t_e[:_r_e_v]
                  sets the state attribute of the revision _r_e_v to
                  _s_t_a_t_e.  If _r_e_v is a branch number,  the  latest
                  revision  on that branch is assumed.  If _r_e_v is
                  omitted, the latest  revision  on  the  default
                  branch   is   assumed.    Any   identifier   is
                  acceptable for _s_t_a_t_e.  A useful set  of  states
                  is  _E_x_p  (for experimental), _S_t_a_b (for stable),
                  and _R_e_l (for  released).   By  default,  _c_i(1L)
                  sets the state of a revision to _E_x_p.

       --tt[_t_x_t_f_i_l_e]
                  writes  descriptive  text  into  the  RCS  file
                  (deletes the existing  text).   If  _t_x_t_f_i_l_e  is
                  omitted, _r_c_s prompts the user for text supplied
                  from the standard input, terminated with a line
                  containing   a   single   `.'   or   control-D.
                  Otherwise, the descriptive text is copied  from
                  the file _t_x_t_f_i_l_e.  If the --ii option is present,
                  descriptive text is requested even if --tt is not
                  given.    The   prompt  is  suppressed  if  the
                  standard input is not a terminal.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       The RCS file name and the revisions outdated  are  written
       to  the  diagnostic output.  The exit status always refers
       to the last RCS file  operated  upon,  and  is  0  if  the
       operation was successful, 1 otherwise.

FFIILLEESS
       The  caller of the command must have read/write permission
       for  the  directory  containing  the  RCS  file  and  read
       permission  for  the  RCS  file  itself.   _R_c_s  creates  a
       semaphore file in the same directory as the  RCS  file  to
       prevent  simultaneous  update.   For  changes,  _r_c_s always
       creates a new file. On successful completion, _r_c_s  deletes
       the  old one and renames the new one.  This strategy makes
       links to RCS files useless.
