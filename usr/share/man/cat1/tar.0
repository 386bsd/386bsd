       The  _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n,  _o_p_t_i_o_n_s,  and  _f_i_l_e_s-_l_i_s_t  components  are
       described  below  in sections with those names.  There are
       several  conventions  which  may  be   followed   in   the
       specification  of  arguments for _t_a_r.  These are described
       below under SYNTAX.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The _t_a_r utility provides a way to store many files  in  an
       archive (sometimes called a tar-file) which may be kept as
       an ordinary file, stored on an I/O device such as tape  or
       disk, sent over a network, or piped to another program.

       It  is especially  useful for making backup copies and for
       packaging a set of files for convenience of handling or to
       move them to another system.

       When desired, copies of the archived files may be fully or
       selectively  retrieved  from  the   archive   by   another
       application of _t_a_r.

       You  may  also  use  _t_a_r to append, delete, update or list
       files in an archive or to  compare  an  archive  with  the
       current state of a filesystem subtree.

       The  _t_a_r  utility  is  available  for  a  wide  variety of
       operating systems and computer architectures  which  makes
       it  particularly useful for intersystem transfers.  Source
       code for _t_a_r is freely available to simplify porting it to
       additional systems.

SSYYNNTTAAXX
       Arguments  to  _t_a_r can be specified in several ways.  This
       is largely to accommodate  different  preferences  in  the
       trade off between compactness on the one hand and improved
       mnemonic value and accompanying verbosity  on  the  other,
       and to allow the continued use of old forms which have had
       widespread use.

       CCoommppaacctt SSyynnttaaxx
       The normal compact command syntax conventions can be used:

              The  function  designation  conventionally  appears
              first and each option is separated by  white  space
              and  indicated  by  a `-' followed immediately by a
              letter.   Any  required  value  for  an  option  is
              supplied by an argument which directly follows that
              option;

TAR(1)                         1994                        TAR(1)


              Multiple options can be combined behind one `-'  as
              long as they take no arguments.

       KKeeyywwoorrdd SSyynnttaaxx
       The  more  mnemonic  but  more  verbose  keyword system of
       specifying arguments is structurally similar to the  first
       form  above but each option is specified by a full word or
       hyphenated phrase and the lead-in is a `--' instead  of  a
       single  `-'.   All  arguments are separated by white space
       and each value directly follows the corresponding keyword.

       TTrraaddiittiioonnaall SSyynnttaaxx
       For  compatibility  with  traditional  _t_a_r  programs,  the
       function  and   options   may   also   be   specified   as
       ``keyletters''  in  the first argument to _t_a_r omitting the
       initial `-'.  Any values required by the options occur  as
       the  second, third, etc.  arguments in the same order that
       the keyletters appeared.

       EExxaammpplleess::
       The following examples show a sample command expressed  in
       each of the styles described above:

       Compact:

       Keyword:
              tar --create --file arcname --verbose file1 file2

FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNSS
       Exactly one of the functions in the following list must be
       included.  The list includes each  of  the  compact  forms
       followed by the corresponding keyword or words.

       --AA,, ----ccaatteennaattee,, ----ccoonnccaatteennaattee
              Append existing tar-files to the archive.

       --cc,, ----ccrreeaattee
              Create a new archive containing the items specified
              by the _f_i_l_e_s-_l_i_s_t.

       --dd,, ----ddiiffff,, ----ccoommppaarree
              Find differences between the archive and  the  file
              system.
              Report  differences  in  file size, mode, uid, gid,
              and contents.  If a file exists on  the  tape,  but
              not in the file system, that is reported.

       --rr,, ----aappppeenndd
              Append list items to the end of the archive.

       --tt,, ----lliisstt
              List  a  table  of contents of an existing archive.
              If  file  names  are  specified,  just  list  files
              matching  the specified names.  The listing appears
              on the standard output.

       --uu,, ----uuppddaattee
              Only  append list items that  are  newer  than  the
              current copy in the archive.

       --xx,, ----eexxttrraacctt,, ----ggeett
              Extract files from an existing archive.  If a _f_i_l_e-
              _l_i_s_t is specified, just extract files matching  the
              list  items, otherwise extract all the files in the
              archive.

       To reduce the danger of accidental data loss the following
       keyword function has no compact form.

       ----ddeelleettee
              Delete  _f_i_l_e_s-_l_i_s_t from the archive (not for use on
              mag tapes!).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The corresponding keywords are shown following the compact
       forms in the following list.

       --bb,, ----bblloocckk--ssiizzee _N
              Specify  a  blocking  factor  for the archive.  The
              block size will be _N x 512  bytes.   Larger  blocks
              typically run faster and let you fit more data on a
              tape.
              The default blocking factor  is  set  when  _t_a_r  is
              compiled, and is typically 20.
              The  maximum block size is limited by the lesser of
              the amount of memory that can be  allocated  for  a
              block  and  the  maximum block size that the device
              containing the archive can read or write.

       --BB,, ----rreeaadd--ffuullll--bblloocckkss
              When reading an archive, reblock it as we read  it.
              Normally,  _t_a_r  reads  each  block  with  a  single
              _r_e_a_d(_2) system  call.   This  does  not  work  when
              reading  from  a  pipe  or  network socket under  .
              _r_e_a_d(_2) only gives as much data as has  arrived  at
              the  moment.  With this option, it will do multiple
              _r_e_a_d(_2)s to fill out to a record  boundary,  rather
              than  reporting  an  error.   This  option  is  the
              default  when  reading  an  archive  from  standard
              input, or over a network.

       --CC,, ----ddiirreeccttoorryy _D_I_R
              Change  working directory to _D_I_R.  This is the only
              option which may usefully appear more than once and

              may appear after the _f_i_l_e_s-_l_i_s_t begins.  It changes
              the working directory for locating items  following
              it  in  the  list until another --CC option occurs or
              the end of the list is reached.
              The --CC and --TT options may not be combined in a  _t_a_r
              command.
              If  you really need to process a file named `-C' it
              can be referred to as `./-C' in the list.

       --ff,, ----ffiillee [_H_O_S_T_N_A_M_E:]_F_I_L_E
              Use archive file or device  _F_I_L_E  (the  default  is
              taken  from  the environment variable TAPE if it is
              defined, otherwise /dev/tape is used).
              If the `-' character appears alone as  the  archive
              name, it indicates that the standard input is to be
              read as the archive or that standard output  is  to
              be written as the archive according to the function
              being performed.

              Run script at end of each volume  (tape  cartridge,
              diskette,  etc.)   This  option  implies the multi-
              volume option B-MP.

       --GG,, ----iinnccrreemmeennttaall
              Create,    extract,    etc.     old      GNU-format
              incremental backup.

              incremental backup.

       --hh,, ----ddeerreeffeerreennccee
              When creating an archive, if  a  symbolic  link  is
              encountered, dump the file or directory to which it
              points, rather than dumping it as a symbolic  link.

       --ii,, ----iiggnnoorree--zzeerrooss
              When  reading  an  archive,  ignore blocks of zeros
              appearing as headers in the archive.  Normally such
              a  block of zeros indicates the end of the archive,
              but in a damaged archive, or one which was  created
              by  appending  several archives, this option allows
              _t_a_r to continue.
              This option is not on by default because  there  is
              garbage  written  after  the  zeroed blocks by some
              versions of the _t_a_r program.  Note that  with  this
              option set, _t_a_r will read all the way to the end of
              the file, eliminating some problems with multi-file
              tapes.

       --kk,, ----kkeeeepp--oolldd--ffiilleess

       --KK,, ----ssttaarrttiinngg--ffiillee _F_I_L_E

              When  dumping  the  contents  of  a directory to an
              archive, stay within the local file system of  that
              directory.  That is, do not process the contents of
              a directory  which  is  a  filesystem  mount  point
              encountered  while  processing a directory included
              in the _f_i_l_e_s-_l_i_s_t.
              This option only affects the files  dumped  because
              they  are in a dumped directory; files named on the
              command line are always dumped,  and  they  can  be
              from various file systems.
              This  is  useful  for making ``full dump'' archival
              backups of a  file  system,  as  with  the  _d_u_m_p(8)
              command.   Files  which  are  skipped  due  to this
              option are mentioned on the standard error.

       --LL,, ----ttaappee--lleennggtthh _N
              Change tape,  diskette,  etc.  after  writing  each

       --mm,, ----mmooddiiffiiccaattiioonn--ttiimmee
              When  extracting  files  from  an archive, set each
              file's modification timestamp to the current  time,
              rather  than  extracting  each  file's modification
              timestamp from the archive.

       --MM,, ----mmuullttii--vvoolluummee

              When creating  an  archive,  write  an  old  format
              archive,  which  does not include information about
              directories, pipes,  fifos,  contiguous  files,  or
              device files, and specifies file ownership by uid's
              and gid's rather  than  by  user  names  and  group
              names.  In most cases, a ``new'' format archive can
              be read by an ``old'' tar program  without  serious
              trouble, so this option should seldom be needed.

              When  writing  each message for a file incorporated
              into the archive show  the  record  position,  i.e.
              which  512 byte block within the archive begins the
              file record and contains the header information for
              the file.
              This  option  is  especially  useful  when  reading
              damaged archives, since it helps  to  pinpoint  the
              damaged section.

              When using the --TT option to specify the items to be
              listed, compared or extracted from an archive,  the
              --ss  flag specifies that the list is sorted into the
              same order as the archive.   This  allows  a  large
              list  to  be  used, even on small machines, because
              the entire list need not be  read  into  memory  at
              once.
              Such a sorted list can easily be created by running

              Get the _f_i_l_e_s-_l_i_s_t to extract, include,  etc.  from
              file  _F_I_L_E  (one  item  per  line)  instead  of the
              command line.  _F_I_L_E may not include occurrences  of
              the --CC option.
              If  _F_I_L_E  is the `-' character alone the _f_i_l_e_s-_l_i_s_t
              is taken from the  standard  input,  one  item  per
              line.
              If  the  --TT option is used, the _f_i_l_e_s-_l_i_s_t, if any,
              appearing in the command will be ignored.
              The --TT and --CC options may not be combined in a  _t_a_r
              command.

              If --vv is used with the --tt function the message  for
              each  file  is  expanded  to  give  details of file

FFIILLEESS LLIISSTT
       The  _f_i_l_e_s-_l_i_s_t  may contain working directory changes and
       the names of items which are to  be  archived,  extracted,
       etc.  according to the function selected.

       --CC _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y__n_a_m_e
              This  is  an  instruction  to  change  the  working
              directory  to  the  specified  directory.   Details
              appear in the description of --CC under OPTIONS.

       _f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
              A  file name as an item implies only the processing
              of the named file.

       _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y__n_a_m_e
              A directory name as an item implies that the entire
              filesystem subtree based there should be processed.

       By default, if a full path name is specified when creating
       an  archive, it will be written to the archive without the
       initial "/", to allow the files to be later  read  into  a
       different  place  than  where they were dumped from, and a
       warning will be printed.

       If files are extracted from an archive which contains full
       path names, they will be extracted relative to the current
       directory and a warning message printed.

       To modify the default behaviour use the -_P _o_r  --_a_b_s_o_l_u_t_e-
       _p_a_t_h_s option.

       When  extracting,  comparing  or  listing  an archive, the
       items in the _f_i_l_e_s-_l_i_s_t refer to records  in  the  archive
       and   may   contain  wild  card  characters  for  filename
       substitution using mostly the same forms as the shell, _s_h.
       The  shell  actually matches each substring between ``/''s
       separately, while _t_a_r matches the entire string  at  once,
       so  some  anomalies  will  occur;  e.g. ``*'' or ``?'' can
       match a ``/''.
       To specify a regular expression as  an  argument  to  _t_a_r,
       quote it so the shell will not expand it.
