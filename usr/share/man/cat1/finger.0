     The ffiinnggeerr displays information about the system users.

     Options are:

     --ss    FFiinnggeerr displays the user's login name, real name, terminal name and
           write status (as a ``*'' after the terminal name if write
           permission is denied), idle time, login time, office location and
           office phone number.

           Idle time is in minutes if it is a single integer, hours and
           minutes if a ``:'' is present, or days if a ``d'' is present.
           Login time is displayed as month, day, hours and minutes, unless
           more than six months ago, in which case the year is displayed
           rather than the hours and minutes.

           Unknown devices as well as nonexistent idle and login times are
           displayed as single asterisks.

     --ll    Produces a multi-line format displaying all of the information
           described for the --ss option as well as the user's home directory,
           home phone number, login shell, and the contents of the files
           ``._f_o_r_w_a_r_d'', ``._p_l_a_n'' and ``._p_r_o_j_e_c_t'' from the user's home
           directory.

           If idle time is at least a minute and less than a day, it is
           presented in the form ``hh:mm''.  Idle times greater than a day are
           presented as ``d day[s]hh:mm''.

           Phone numbers specified as eleven digits are printed as ``+N-NNN-
           NNN-NNNN''.  Numbers specified as ten or seven digits are printed
           as the appropriate subset of that string.  Numbers specified as
           five digits are printed as ``xN-NNNN''.

           If write permission is denied to the device, the phrase ``(messages
           off)'' is appended to the line containing the device name.  One
           entry per user is displayed with the --ll option; if a user is logged
           on multiple times, terminal information is repeated once per login.

     --pp    Prevents the --ll option of ffiinnggeerr from displaying the contents of
           the ``._f_o_r_w_a_r_d'', ``._p_l_a_n'' and ``._p_r_o_j_e_c_t'' files.

     --mm    Prevent matching of _u_s_e_r names.  _U_s_e_r is usually a login name;
           however, matching will also be done on the users' real names,
           unless the --mm option is supplied.  All name matching performed by
           ffiinnggeerr is case insensitive.

     If no options are specified, ffiinnggeerr defaults to the --ll style output if
     operands are provided, otherwise to the --ss style.  Note that some fields
     may be missing, in either format, if information is not available for
     them.

     If no arguments are specified, ffiinnggeerr will print an entry for each user
     currently logged into the system.

     FFiinnggeerr may be used to look up users on a remote machine.  The format is
     to specify a _u_s_e_r as ``user@host'', or ``@host'', where the default
     output format for the former is the --ll style, and the default output
     format for the latter is the --ss style.  The --ll option is the only option
     that may be passed to a remote machine.
