IINNTTRROODDUUCCTTIIOONN
     MMaaiill is a intelligent mail processing system, which has a command syntax
     reminiscent of ed(1) with lines replaced by messages.

     --vv    Verbose mode.  The details of delivery are displayed on the users
           terminal.

     --ii    Ignore tty interrupt signals.  This is particularly useful when
           using mmaaiill on noisy phone lines.

     --II    Forces mail to run in interactive mode even when input isn't a
           terminal.  In particular, the `~~' special character when sending
           mail is only active in interactive mode.

     --nn    Inhibits reading /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_m_i_s_c/_M_a_i_l._r_c upon startup.

     --NN    Inhibits the initial display of message headers when reading mail
           or editing a mail folder.

     --ss    Specify subject on command line (only the first argument after the
           --ss flag is used as a subject; be careful to quote subjects
           containing spaces.)

     --cc    Send carbon copies to _l_i_s_t of users.

     --bb    Send blind carbon copies to _l_i_s_t. List should be a comma-separated
           list of names.

     --ff    Read in the contents of your _m_b_o_x (or the specified file) for
           processing; when you _q_u_i_t, mmaaiill writes undeleted messages back to
           this file.

     --uu    Is equivalent to:

                 mail -f /var/spool/mail/user

   SSeennddiinngg mmaaiill
     To send a message to one or more people, mmaaiill can be invoked with
     arguments which are the names of people to whom the mail will be sent.
     You are then expected to type in your message, followed by an `control-D'
     at the beginning of a line.  The section below _R_e_p_l_y_i_n_g _t_o _o_r _o_r_i_g_i_n_a_t_i_n_g
     _m_a_i_l, describes some features of mmaaiill available to help you compose your
     letter.

   RReeaaddiinngg mmaaiill
     In normal usage mmaaiill is given no arguments and checks your mail out of
     the post office, then prints out a one line header of each message found.
     The current message is initially the first message (numbered 1) and can
     be printed using the pprriinntt command (which can be abbreviated `pp'). You
     can move among the messages much as you move between lines in ed(1),
     with the commands `++' and `--' moving backwards and forwards, and simple
     numbers.

   DDiissppoossiinngg ooff mmaaiill..
     After examining a message you can ddeelleettee `dd') the message or rreeppllyy `rr')
     to it.  Deletion causes the mmaaiill program to forget about the message.
     This is not irreversible; the message can be uunnddeelleetteedd `uu') by giving its
     number, or the mmaaiill session can be aborted by giving the eexxiitt `xx')
     command.  Deleted messages will, however, usually disappear never to be
     seen again.

   SSppeecciiffyyiinngg mmeessssaaggeess
     Commands such as pprriinntt and ddeelleettee can be given a list of message numbers
     as arguments to apply to a number of messages at once.  Thus ``delete 1
     2'' deletes messages 1 and 2, while ``delete 1-5'' deletes messages 1
     through 5.  The special name `*' addresses all messages, and `$'
     addresses the last message; thus the command ttoopp which prints the first
     few lines of a message could be used in ``top *'' to print the first few
     lines of all messages.

   RReeppllyyiinngg ttoo oorr oorriiggiinnaattiinngg mmaaiill..
     You can use the rreeppllyy command to set up a response to a message, sending
     it back to the person who it was from.  Text you then type in, up to an
     end-of-file, defines the contents of the message.  While you are
     composing a message, mmaaiill treats lines beginning with the character `~~'
     specially.  For instance, typing `~~mm' (alone on a line) will place a copy
     of the current message into the response right shifting it by a tabstop
     (see _i_n_d_e_n_t_p_r_e_f_i_x variable, below).  Other escapes will set up subject
     fields, add and delete recipients to the message and allow you to escape
     to an editor to revise the message or to a shell to run some commands.
     (These options are given in the summary below.)

   EEnnddiinngg aa mmaaiill pprroocceessssiinngg sseessssiioonn..
     You can end a mmaaiill session with the qquuiitt `qq') command.  Messages which
     have been examined go to your _m_b_o_x file unless they have been deleted in
     which case they are discarded.  Unexamined messages go back to the post
     office.  (See the --ff option above).

     It is also possible to create a personal distribution lists so that, for
     instance, you can send mail to ``cohorts'' and have it go to a group of
     people.  Such lists can be defined by placing a line like

           alias cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark kridle@ucbcory

     in the file ._m_a_i_l_r_c in your home directory.  The current list of such
     aliases can be displayed with the aalliiaass command in mmaaiill. System wide
     distribution lists can be created by editing /_e_t_c/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s, see aliases(5)
     and sendmail(8);  these are kept in a different syntax.  In mail you
     send, personal aliases will be expanded in mail sent to others so that
     they will be able to rreeppllyy to the recipients.  System wide aalliiaasseess are
     not expanded when the mail is sent, but any reply returned to the machine
     will have the system wide alias expanded as all mail goes through
     sendmail.

     See mailaddr(7) for a description of network addresses.

     MMaaiill has a number of options which can be set in the ._m_a_i_l_r_c file to
     alter its behavior; thus ``set askcc'' enables the _a_s_k_c_c feature.  (These
     options are summarized below.)

SSUUMMMMAARRYY
     (Adapted from the `Mail Reference Manual')

     Each command is typed on a line by itself, and may take arguments
     following the command word.  The command need not be typed in its
     entirety - the first command which matches the typed prefix is used.  For
     commands which take message lists as arguments, if no message list is
     given, then the next message forward which satisfies the command's
     requirements is used.  If there are no messages forward of the current
     message, the search proceeds backwards, and if there are no good messages
     at all, mmaaiill types ``applicable messages'' and aborts the command.

     --       Print out the preceding message.  If given a numeric argument _n,
             goes to the _n'th previous message and prints it.

     ??       Prints a brief summary of commands.

     !!       Executes the shell (see sh(1) and csh(1))  command which follows.

     PPrriinntt   (PP) Like pprriinntt but also prints out ignored header fields.  See
             also pprriinntt, iiggnnoorree and rreettaaiinn.

     RReeppllyy   (RR) Reply to originator.  Does not reply to other recipients of
             the original message.

     TTyyppee    (TT) Identical to the PPrriinntt command.

     aalliiaass   (aa) With no arguments, prints out all currently-defined aliases.
             With one argument, prints out that alias.  With more than one
             argument, creates a new alias or changes an old one.

     aalltteerrnnaatteess
             (aalltt) The aalltteerrnnaatteess command is useful if you have accounts on
             several machines.  It can be used to inform mmaaiill that the listed
             addresses are really you.  When you rreeppllyy to messages, mmaaiill will
             not send a copy of the message to any of the addresses listed on
             the aalltteerrnnaatteess list.  If the aalltteerrnnaatteess command is given with no
             argument, the current set of alternate names is displayed.

     cchhddiirr   (cc) Changes the user's working directory to that specified, if
             given.  If no directory is given, then changes to the user's
             login directory.

     ccooppyy    (ccoo) The ccooppyy command does the same thing that ssaavvee does, except
             that it does not mark the messages it is used on for deletion
             when you quit.

     ddeelleettee  (dd) Takes a list of messages as argument and marks them all as
             deleted.  Deleted messages will not be saved in _m_b_o_x, nor will
             they be available for most other commands.

     ddpp      (also ddtt) Deletes the current message and prints the next
             message.  If there is no next message, mmaaiill says ``at EOF''.

     eeddiitt    (ee) Takes a list of messages and points the text editor at each
             one in turn.  On return from the editor, the message is read back
             in.

     eexxiitt    (eexx or xx) Effects an immediate return to the Shell without
             modifying the user's system mailbox, his _m_b_o_x file, or his edit
             file in --ff.

     ffiillee    (ffii) The same as ffoollddeerr.

     ffoollddeerrss
             List the names of the folders in your folder directory.

     ffoollddeerr  (ffoo) The ffoollddeerr command switches to a new mail file or folder.
             With no arguments, it tells you which file you are currently
             reading.  If you give it an argument, it will write out changes
             (such as deletions) you have made in the current file and read in
             the new file.  Some special conventions are recognized for the
             name.  # means the previous file, % means your system mailbox,
             %user means user's system mailbox, & means your _m_b_o_x file, and

             +folder means a file in your folder directory.

     ffrroomm    (ff) Takes a list of messages and prints their message headers.

     hheeaaddeerrss
             (hh) Lists the current range of headers, which is an 18-message
             group.  If a `+' argument is given, then the next 18-message
             group is printed, and if a `-' argument is given, the previous
             18-message group is printed.

     hheellpp    A synonym for ??

     hhoolldd    (hhoo, also pprreesseerrvvee) Takes a message list and marks each message
             therein to be saved in the user's system mailbox instead of in
             _m_b_o_x. Does not override the ddeelleettee command.

     iiggnnoorree  Add the list of header fields named to the _i_g_n_o_r_e_d _l_i_s_t Header
             fields in the ignore list are not printed on your terminal when
             you print a message.  This command is very handy for suppression
             of certain machine-generated header fields.  The TTyyppee and PPrriinntt
             commands can be used to print a message in its entirety,
             including ignored fields.  If iiggnnoorree is executed with no
             arguments, it lists the current set of ignored fields.

     mmaaiill    (mm) Takes as argument login names and distribution group names
             and sends mail to those people.

     mmbbooxx    Indicate that a list of messages be sent to mmbbooxx in your home
             directory when you quit.  This is the default action for messages
             if you do _n_o_t have the hhoolldd option set.

     nneexxtt    (nn) like ++ or CR) Goes to the next message in sequence and types
             it.  With an argument list, types the next matching message.

     pprreesseerrvvee
             (pprree) A synonym for hhoolldd.

     pprriinntt   (pp) Takes a message list and types out each message on the user's
             terminal.

     qquuiitt    (qq) Terminates the session, saving all undeleted, unsaved
             messages in the user's _m_b_o_x file in his login directory,
             preserving all messages marked with hhoolldd or pprreesseerrvvee or never
             referenced in his system mailbox, and removing all other messages
             from his system mailbox.  If new mail has arrived during the
             session, the message ``You have new mail'' is given.  If given
             while editing a mailbox file with the --ff flag, then the edit file
             is rewritten.  A return to the Shell is effected, unless the
             rewrite of edit file fails, in which case the user can escape
             with the eexxiitt command.

     rreeppllyy   (rr) Takes a message list and sends mail to the sender and all
             recipients of the specified message.  The default message must
             not be deleted.

     rreessppoonndd
             A synonym for rreeppllyy.

     rreettaaiinn  Add the list of header fields named to the _r_e_t_a_i_n_e_d _l_i_s_t Only the
             header fields in the retain list are shown on your terminal when
             you print a message.  All other header fields are suppressed.
             The TTyyppee and PPrriinntt commands can be used to print a message in its
             entirety.  If rreettaaiinn is executed with no arguments, it lists the
             current set of retained fields.

     ssaavvee    (ss) Takes a message list and a filename and appends each message
             in turn to the end of the file.  The filename in quotes, followed
             by the line count and character count is echoed on the user's
             terminal.

     sseett     (ssee) With no arguments, prints all variable values.  Otherwise,
             sets option.  Arguments are of the form _o_p_t_i_o_n=_v_a_l_u_e (no space
             before or after =) or _o_p_t_i_o_n. Quotation marks may be placed
             around any part of the assignment statement to quote blanks or
             tabs, i.e.  ``set indentprefix="->"''

     ssaavveeiiggnnoorree
             SSaavveeiiggnnoorree is to ssaavvee what iiggnnoorree is to pprriinntt and ttyyppee. Header
             fields thus marked are filtered out when saving a message by ssaavvee
             or when automatically saving to _m_b_o_x.

     ssaavveerreettaaiinn
             SSaavveerreettaaiinn is to ssaavvee what rreettaaiinn is to pprriinntt and ttyyppee. Header
             fields thus marked are the only ones saved with a message when
             saving by ssaavvee or when automatically saving to _m_b_o_x. SSaavveerreettaaiinn
             overrides ssaavveeiiggnnoorree.

     sshheellll   (sshh) Invokes an interactive version of the shell.

     ssiizzee    Takes a message list and prints out the size in characters of
             each message.

     ssoouurrccee  The ssoouurrccee command reads commands from a file.

     ttoopp     Takes a message list and prints the top few lines of each.  The
             number of lines printed is controlled by the variable ttoopplliinneess
             and defaults to five.

     ttyyppee    (tt) A synonym for pprriinntt.

     uunnaalliiaass
             Takes a list of names defined by aalliiaass commands and discards the
             remembered groups of users.  The group names no longer have any
             significance.

     uunnddeelleettee
             (uu) Takes a message list and marks each message as nnoott being
             deleted.

     uunnrreeaadd  (UU) Takes a message list and marks each message as nnoott having
             been read.

     uunnsseett   Takes a list of option names and discards their remembered
             values; the inverse of sseett.

     vviissuuaall  (vv) Takes a message list and invokes the display editor on each
             message.

     wwrriittee   (ww) Similar to ssaavvee, except that oonnllyy the message body (_w_i_t_h_o_u_t)
             the header) is saved.  Extremely useful for such tasks as sending
             and receiving source program text over the message system.

     xxiitt     (xx) A synonym for eexxiitt.

     zz       MMaaiill presents message headers in windowfuls as described under
             the hheeaaddeerrss command.  You can move mmaaiill's attention forward to
             the next window with the zz command.  Also, you can move to the
             previous window by using zz--.

   TTiillddee//EEssccaappeess


     Here is a summary of the tilde escapes, which are used when composing
     messages to perform special functions.  Tilde escapes are only recognized
     at the beginning of lines.  The name ``_t_i_l_d_e _e_s_c_a_p_e'' is somewhat of a
     misnomer since the actual escape character can be set by the option
     eessccaappee.

     ~~!!_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
             Execute the indicated shell command, then return to the message.

     ~~bb_n_a_m_e ...
             Add the given names to the list of carbon copy recipients but do
             not make the names visible in the Cc: line ("blind" carbon copy).

     ~~cc_n_a_m_e ...
             Add the given names to the list of carbon copy recipients.

     ~~dd      Read the file ``_d_e_a_d._l_e_t_t_e_r'' from your home directory into the
             message.

     ~~ee      Invoke the text editor on the message collected so far.  After
             the editing session is finished, you may continue appending text
             to the message.

     ~~ff_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s
             Read the named messages into the message being sent.  If no
             messages are specified, read in the current message.  Message
             headers currently being ignored (by the iiggnnoorree or rreettaaiinn command)
             are not included.

     ~~FF_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s
             Identical to ~~ff, except all message headers are included.

     ~~hh      Edit the message header fields by typing each one in turn and
             allowing the user to append text to the end or modify the field
             by using the current terminal erase and kill characters.

     ~~mm_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s
             Read the named messages into the message being sent, indented by
             a tab or by the value of _i_n_d_e_n_t_p_r_e_f_i_x. If no messages are
             specified, read the current message.  Message headers currently
             being ignored (by the iiggnnoorree or rreettaaiinn command) are not included.

     ~~MM_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s
             Identical to ~~mm, except all message headers are included.

     ~~pp      Print out the message collected so far, prefaced by the message
             header fields.

     ~~qq      Abort the message being sent, copying the message to
             ``_d_e_a_d._l_e_t_t_e_r'' in your home directory if ssaavvee is set.

     ~~rr_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
             Read the named file into the message.

     ~~ss_s_t_r_i_n_g
             Cause the named string to become the current subject field.

     ~~tt_n_a_m_e ...
             Add the given names to the direct recipient list.

     ~~vv      Invoke an alternate editor (defined by the VISUAL option) on the
             message collected so far.  Usually, the alternate editor will be
             a screen editor.  After you quit the editor, you may resume
             appending text to the end of your message.

     ~~ww_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

             Write the message onto the named file.

     ~~||_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
             Pipe the message through the command as a filter.  If the command
             gives no output or terminates abnormally, retain the original
             text of the message.  The command fmt(1) is often used as ccoommmmaanndd
             to rejustify the message.

     ~~::_m_a_i_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
             Execute the given mail command.  Not all commands, however, are
             allowed.

     ~~~~_s_t_r_i_n_g
             Insert the string of text in the message prefaced by a single ~.
             If you have changed the escape character, then you should double
             that character in order to send it.

   MMaaiill OOppttiioonnss
     Options are controlled via sseett and uunnsseett commands.  Options may be either
     binary, in which case it is only significant to see whether they are set
     or not; or string, in which case the actual value is of interest.  The
     binary options include the following:

     _a_p_p_e_n_d  Causes messages saved in _m_b_o_x to be appended to the end rather
             than prepended.  This should always be set (perhaps in
             /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_m_i_s_c/_M_a_i_l._r_c).

     _a_s_k     Causes mmaaiill to prompt you for the subject of each message you
             send.  If you respond with simply a newline, no subject field
             will be sent.

     _a_s_k_c_c   Causes you to be prompted for additional carbon copy recipients
             at the end of each message.  Responding with a newline indicates
             your satisfaction with the current list.

     _a_u_t_o_p_r_i_n_t
             Causes the ddeelleettee command to behave like ddpp - thus, after
             deleting a message, the next one will be typed automatically.

     _d_e_b_u_g   Setting the binary option _d_e_b_u_g is the same as specifying --dd on
             the command line and causes mmaaiill to output all sorts of
             information useful for debugging mmaaiill.

     _d_o_t     The binary option _d_o_t causes mmaaiill to interpret a period alone on
             a line as the terminator of a message you are sending.

     _h_o_l_d    This option is used to hold messages in the system mailbox by
             default.

     _i_g_n_o_r_e  Causes interrupt signals from your terminal to be ignored and
             echoed as @'s.

     _i_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f
             An option related to _d_o_t is _i_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f which makes mmaaiill refuse to
             accept a control-d as the end of a message.  _I_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f also
             applies to mmaaiill command mode.

     _m_e_t_o_o   Usually, when a group is expanded that contains the sender, the
             sender is removed from the expansion.  Setting this option causes
             the sender to be included in the group.

     _n_o_h_e_a_d_e_r
             Setting the option _n_o_h_e_a_d_e_r is the same as giving the --NN flag on


             the command line.

     _n_o_s_a_v_e  Normally, when you abort a message with two RUBOUT (erase or
             delete) mmaaiill copies the partial letter to the file
             ``_d_e_a_d._l_e_t_t_e_r'' in your home directory.  Setting the binary
             option _n_o_s_a_v_e prevents this.

     _R_e_p_l_y_a_l_l
             Reverses the sense of rreeppllyy and RReeppllyy commands.

     _q_u_i_e_t   Suppresses the printing of the version when first invoked.

     _v_e_r_b_o_s_e
             Setting the option _v_e_r_b_o_s_e is the same as using the --vv flag on
             the command line.  When mail runs in verbose mode, the actual
             delivery of messages is displayed on he users terminal.

   OOppttiioonn SSttrriinngg VVaalluueess

     EDITOR        Pathname of the text editor to use in the eeddiitt command and
                   ~~ee escape.  If not defined, then a default editor is used.

     LISTER        Pathname of the directory lister to use in the ffoollddeerrss
                   command.  Default is /_b_i_n/_l_s.

     PAGER         Pathname of the program to use in the mmoorree command or when
                   ccrrtt variable is set.  The default paginator more(1) is used
                   if this option is not defined.

     SHELL         Pathname of the shell to use in the !! command and the ~~!!
                   escape.  A default shell is used if this option is not
                   defined.

     VISUAL        Pathname of the text editor to use in the vviissuuaall command
                   and ~~vv escape.

     _c_r_t           The valued option _c_r_t is used as a threshold to determine
                   how long a message must be before PAGER is used to read it.
                   If _c_r_t is set without a value, then the height of the
                   terminal screen stored in the system is used to compute the
                   threshold (see stty(1)).

     _e_s_c_a_p_e        If defined, the first character of this option gives the
                   character to use in the place of ~ to denote escapes.

     _f_o_l_d_e_r        The name of the directory to use for storing folders of
                   messages.  If this name begins with a `/', mmaaiill considers
                   it to be an absolute pathname; otherwise, the folder
                   directory is found relative to your home directory.

     MBOX          The name of the _m_b_o_x file.  It can be the name of a folder.
                   The default is ``mbox'' in the user's home directory.

     _r_e_c_o_r_d        If defined, gives the pathname of the file used to record
                   all outgoing mail.  If not defined, then outgoing mail is
                   not so saved.

     _i_n_d_e_n_t_p_r_e_f_i_x  String used by the ``~m'' tilde escape for indenting
                   messages, in place of the normal tab character (^I).  Be
                   sure to quote the value if it contains spaces or tabs.

     _t_o_p_l_i_n_e_s      If defined, gives the number of lines of a message to be
                   printed out with the ttoopp command; normally, the first five
                   lines are printed.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     MMaaiill utilizes the HOME and USER environment variables.

FFIILLEESS
     /var/spool/mail/*           Post office.
     ~/mbox                      User's old mail.
     ~/.mailrc                   File giving initial mail commands.
     /tmp/R*                     Temporary files.
     /usr/share/misc/Mail.help*  Help files.
     /usr/share/misc/Mail.rc     System initialization file.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     fmt(1),  newaliases(1),  vacation(1),  aliases(5),  mailaddr(7),
     sendmail(8) and

     _T_h_e _M_a_i_l _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _M_a_n_u_a_l..

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     A mmaaiill command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.  This man page is derived
     from _T_h_e _M_a_i_l _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _M_a_n_u_a_l originally written by Kurt Shoens.

BBUUGGSS
     There are some flags that are not documented here.  Most are not useful
     to the general user.

     Usually, mmaaiill is just a link to MMaaiill, which can be confusing.
