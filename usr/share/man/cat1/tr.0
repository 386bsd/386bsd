     ttrr - Translate Characters.

     The tr utility copies the standard input to the standard output with
     substitution or deletion of selected characters.  The options specified
     and the _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 and _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 operands control translations that occur
     while copying characters.

     The following options are available:

     --cc      Complements the set of characters in string1 with respect to the
             universe of characters whose ISO 646 [4] codes are 00 through
             0377 octal.

     --dd      Deletes all input characters in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1.

     --ss      Squeezes all output strings of one or more instances of a single
             character in _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 to a single instance of that character.
             Input characters found in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 are mapped into the
             corresponding characters of _s_t_r_i_n_g_2. When _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 is shorter than
             _s_t_r_i_n_g_1, _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 is extended to the length of _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 by
             duplicating the last character of _s_t_r_i_n_g_2. If _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 is
             explicitly a string of zero length, _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 is padded with NUL
             characters.

     The following operands are available:

     _s_t_r_i_n_g_1

     _s_t_r_i_n_g_2  Translation character strings.

     If the --cc option is given in conjunction with the --dd option, then only
     those characters found in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 is copied to the standard output.

     The following conventions can be used in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 or _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 or both to
     specify characters, character ranges, character classes, or collating
     elements:

     character    Represents that character.

     \octal       A backslash followed by 1, 2, or 3 octal digits represents a
                  character with that encoded value.  If a \octal sequence is
                  followed by digits, the backslash and up to three digits are
                  interpreted to prepare a character; subsequent digits are
                  interpreted as individual characters.

     \character   A backslash followed by any character except an octal digit
                  represents that character.

     [c-c]        Represents the range of ordered elements between the range
                  endpoints, inclusive.

     [[:class:]]  Represents all characters belonging to the defined character
                  class.  Allowable names for class are:

                        alpha  upper  lower  digit  xdigit  alnum
                        space  punct  print  graph  cntrl



                  The characters placed in ascending order.

     [[=equiv=]]  Represents all characters or collating (sorting) elements
                  belonging to the same equivalence class as equiv.  If there
                  is a secondary ordering within the equivalence class, the
                  characters are ordered in ascending sequence.  Otherwise,
                  they are ordered after their encoded values.

     [[.cs.]]     Represents a collating symbol.  Multicharacter collating
                  symbols shall be represented as collating symbols to
                  distinguish them from a string of the same characters.

     [x*n]        Represents n repeated occurrences of the character or
                  collating symbol x.  This expression is only valid when it
                  occurs in _s_t_r_i_n_g_2. If n is omitted or is zero, it is be
                  interpreted as large enough to extend the _s_t_r_i_n_g_2-based
                  sequence to the length of the _s_t_r_i_n_g_1-based sequence.  If n
                  has a leading zero, it shall be interpreted as an octal
                  value.  Otherwise, it shall be interpreted as a decimal
                  value.

     Characters belonging to an equivalence class occupy the same position in
     the sequence, ordered after secondary ordering.

     The ttrr utility exits with one of the following values:

     0       All input was processed successfully.

     1       An error occurred.

     The ttrr utility is expected to be IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'') compatible.
