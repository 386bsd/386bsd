     rreenniiccee - alter priority of running processes

     rreenniiccee _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y [[--pp] _p_i_d ...] [[--gg] _p_g_r_p ...] [[--uu] _u_s_e_r ...]

     RReenniiccee alters the scheduling priority of one or more running processes.
     The following _w_h_o parameters are interpreted as process ID's, process
     group ID's, or user names.  RReenniiccee'ing a process group causes all pro-
     cesses in the process group to have their scheduling priority altered.
     RReenniiccee'ing a user causes all processes owned by the user to have their
     scheduling priority altered.  By default, the processes to be affected
     are specified by their process ID's.

     Options supported by rreenniiccee:

     --gg      Force _w_h_o parameters to be interpreted as process group ID's.

     --uu      Force the _w_h_o parameters to be interpreted as user names.

     --pp      Resets the _w_h_o interpretation to be (the default) process ID's.

     For example,

     renice +1 987 -u daemon root -p 32

     would change the priority of process ID's 987 and 32, and all processes
     owned by users daemon and root.

     Users other than the super-user may only alter the priority of processes
     they own, and can only monotonically increase their ``nice value'' within
     the range 0 to PRIO_MAX (20).  (This prevents overriding administrative
     fiats.)  The super-user may alter the priority of any process and set the
     priority to any value in the range PRIO_MIN (-20) to PRIO_MAX. Useful
     priorities are: 20 (the affected processes will run only when nothing
     else in the system wants to), 0 (the ``base'' scheduling priority), any-
     thing negative (to make things go very fast).

FFIILLEESS
     /etc/passwd  to map user names to user ID's

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     getpriority(2),  setpriority(2)

BBUUGGSS
     Non super-users can not increase scheduling priorities of their own pro-
     cesses, even if they were the ones that decreased the priorities in the
     first place.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The rreenniiccee command appeared in 4.0BSD.
