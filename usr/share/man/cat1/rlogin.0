     RRllooggiinn starts a terminal session on a remote host _h_o_s_t.

     RRllooggiinn first attempts to use the Kerberos authorization mechanism,
     described below.  If the remote host does not supporting Kerberos the
     standard Berkeley _r_h_o_s_t_s authorization mechanism is used.  The options
     are as follows:

     --88    The --88 option allows an eight-bit input data path at all times;
           otherwise parity bits are stripped except when the remote side's
           stop and start characters are other than ^S/^Q .

     --EE    The --EE option stops any character from being recognized as an
           escape character.  When used with the --88 option, this provides a
           completely transparent connection.

     --KK    The --KK option turns off all Kerberos authentication.

     --LL    The --LL option allows the rlogin session to be run in ``litout''
           (see tty(4))  mode.

     --dd    The --dd option turns on socket debugging (see setsockopt(2))  on the
           TCP sockets used for communication with the remote host.

     --ee    The --ee option allows user specification of the escape character,
           which is ``~'' by default.  This specification may be as a literal
           character, or as an octal value in the form \nnn.

     --kk    The option requests rlogin to obtain tickets for the remote host in
           realm _r_e_a_l_m instead of the remote host's realm as determined by
           krb_realmofhost(3).

     --xx    The --xx option turns on DES encryption for all data passed via the
           rlogin session.  This may impact response time and CPU utilization,
           but provides increased security.

     A line of the form ``<escape char>.'' disconnects from the remote host.
     Similarly, the line ``<escape char>^Z'' will suspend the rrllooggiinn session,
     and ``<escape char><delayed-suspend char>'' suspends the send portion of
     the rlogin, but allows output from the remote system.  By default, the
     tilde (``~'') character is the escape character, and normally control-Y
     (``^Y'') is the delayed-suspend character.

     All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for delays)
     the rrllooggiinn is transparent.  Flow control via ^S/^Q and flushing of input
     and output on interrupts are handled properly.

     Each user may have a private authorization list in the file ._k_l_o_g_i_n in
     their home directory.  Each line in this file should contain a Kerberos
     principal name of the form _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l._i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e@_r_e_a_l_m. If the originating
     user is authenticated to one of the principals named in ._k_l_o_g_i_n, access
     is granted to the account.  The principal _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_n_a_m_e.@_l_o_c_a_l_r_e_a_l_m is
     granted access if there is no ._k_l_o_g_i_n file.  Otherwise a login and
     password will be prompted for on the remote machine as in login(1).  To
     avoid certain security problems, the ._k_l_o_g_i_n file must be owned by the
     remote user.

     If Kerberos authentication fails, a warning message is printed and the
     standard Berkeley rrllooggiinn is used instead.

     The following environment variable is utilized by rrllooggiinn:

     TERM  Determines the user's terminal type.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     rsh(1),  kerberos(3),  krb_sendauth(3),  krb_realmofhost(3)

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The rrllooggiinn command appeared in 4.2BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     RRllooggiinn will be replaced by telnet(1) in the near future.

     More of the environment should be propagated.
