     rrccpp - remote file copy

     RRccpp copies files between machines.  Each _f_i_l_e or _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y argument is
     either a remote file name of the form ``rname@rhost:path'', or a local
     file name (containing no `:' characters, or a `/' before any `:'s).

     --rr    If any of the source files are directories, rrccpp copies each subtree
           rooted at that name; in this case the destination must be a direc-
           tory.

     --pp    The --pp option causes rrccpp to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its
           copies the modification times and modes of the source files, ignor-
           ing the _u_m_a_s_k. By default, the mode and owner of _f_i_l_e_2 are pre-
           served if it already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file
           modified by the umask(2) on the destination host is used.

     --kk    The --kk option requests rrccpp to obtain tickets for the remote host in
           realm _r_e_a_l_m instead of the remote host's realm as determined by
           krb_realmofhost(3).

     --xx    The --xx option turns on DES encryption for all data passed by rrccpp.
           This may impact response time and CPU utilization, but provides in-
           creased security.

     If _p_a_t_h is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to the login
     directory of the specified user _r_u_s_e_r on _r_h_o_s_t, or your current user name
     if no other remote user name is specified.  A _p_a_t_h on a remote host may
     be quoted (using \, ", or ') so that the metacharacters are interpreted
     remotely.

     RRccpp does not prompt for passwords; it performs remote execution via
     rsh(1),  and requires the same authorization.

     RRccpp handles third party copies, where neither source nor target files are
     on the current machine.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The rrccpp command appeared in 4.2BSD. The version of rrccpp described here has
     been reimplemented with Kerberos in 4.3BSD-Reno.

BBUUGGSS
     Doesn't detect all cases where the target of a copy might be a file in
     cases where only a directory should be legal.

     Is confused by any output generated by commands in a ._l_o_g_i_n, ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e, or
     ._c_s_h_r_c file on the remote host.

     The destination user and hostname may have to be specified as
     ``rhost.rname'' when the destination machine is running the 4.2BSD ver-
     sion of rrccpp.
