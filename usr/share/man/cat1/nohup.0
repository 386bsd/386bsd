NNAAMMEE
     nnoohhuupp - invoke a command immune to hangups

     The nnoohhuupp utility invokes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with its arguments and at this time
     sets the signal SIGHUP to be ignored. The signal SIGQUIT may also be set
     to be ignored.  If the standard output is a terminal, the standard output
     is appended to the file _n_o_h_u_p._o_u_t in the current directory.  If standard
     error is a terminal, it is directed to the same place as the standard
     output.

     NNoohhuupp exits 1 if an error occurs, otherwise the exit status is that of
     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

     The following variable is utilized by nnoohhuupp.

     HOME  If the output file _n_o_h_u_p._o_u_t cannot be created in the current
           directory, the nnoohhuupp utility uses the directory named by HOME to
           create the file.

     compatible.
