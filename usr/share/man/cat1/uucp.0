DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _u_u_c_p command copies files between systems.  Each _f_i_l_e
       argument is either a pathname on the local machine  or  is
       of the form

              system!path

       which  is interpreted as being on a remote system.  In the
       first form, the contents of the first file are  copied  to
       the  second.   In  the  second  form,  each source file is
       copied into the destination directory.

       Any pathname that does not begin  with  /  or  ~  will  be
       appended to the current directory; this resulting path may
       not exist on a remote system.  A pathname beginning with a
       simple  ~  starts at the UUCP public directory; a pathname
       beginning with ~name starts at the home directory  of  the
       named  user.  The ~ is interpreted on the appropriate sys-
       tem.  Note that some shells will interpret a simple  ~  to
       the  local  home  directory  before _u_u_c_p sees it; to avoid
       this the ~ must be quoted.

       Shell metacharacters ? * [ ] are interpreted on the appro-
       priate  system,  assuming  they  are quoted to prevent the
       shell from interpreting them first.

       The copy does not take place immediately, but is queued up
       for  the  _u_u_c_i_c_o (8) daemon; the daemon is started immedi-
       ately unless the --rr switch is given.   In  any  case,  the
       next  time the remote system is called the file(s) will be
       copied.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The following options may be given to _u_u_c_p.

       --cc   Do not copy local source files to  the  spool  direc-
            tory.   If they are removed before being processed by
            the _u_u_c_i_c_o (8) daemon, the copy will fail.  The files
            must be readable by the _u_u_c_i_c_o (8) daemon, and by the
            invoking user.

       --CC   Copy local source files to the spool directory.  This
            is the default.

       --dd   Create all necessary directories when doing the copy.
            This is the default.

       --ff   If any necessary directories do  not  exist  for  the
            destination path, abort the copy.

       --gg ggrraaddee
            Set  the grade of the file transfer command.  Jobs of
            a higher grade are executed first.  Grades run 0  ...
            9 A ... Z a ... z from high to low.

       --mm   Report  completion or failure of the file transfer by
            _m_a_i_l (1).

       --nn uusseerr
            Report completion or failure of the file transfer  by
            _m_a_i_l (1) to the named user on the remote system.

       --rr   Do  not  start  _u_u_c_i_c_o (8) daemon immediately; merely
            queue up the file transfer for later execution.

       --jj   Print jobid on standard output.  The job may be later
            cancelled  by  passing  the jobid to the --kk switch of
            _u_u_s_t_a_t (1).  It is possible for some  complex  opera-
            tions  to  produce more than one jobid, in which case
            each will be printed on a separate line.  For example
            uucp        sys1!~user1/file1       sys2!~user2/file2
            /usr/spool/uucppublic  will  generate  two   separate
            jobs,  one for the system _s_y_s_1 and one for the system
            _s_y_s_2.

       --xx ttyyppee
            Turn on particular debugging  types.   The  following
            types  are  recognized:  abnormal,  chat,  handshake,
            uucp-proto, proto, port, config,  spooldir,  execute,
            incoming,  outgoing.  Only abnormal, config, spooldir
            and execute are meaningful for _u_u_c_p.

            Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and
            the  --xx  option  may appear multiple times.  A number
            may also be given, which will turn on that many types
            from the foregoing list; for example, --xx 22 is equiva-
            lent to --xx aabbnnoorrmmaall,,cchhaatt..

       --II ffiillee
            Set configuration file to use.  This option  may  not
            be available, depending upon how _u_u_c_p was compiled.

FFIILLEESS
       The  file  names  may be changed at compilation time or by
       the configuration file, so these are only  approximations.

       /usr/lib/uucp/config - Configuration file.
       /usr/spool/uucp - UUCP spool directory.
       /usr/spool/uucp/Log - UUCP log file.
       /usr/spool/uucppublic - Default UUCP public directory.

BBUUGGSS
       Files can not be copied across multiple systems.

       Some  of  the options are dependent on the capabilities of
       the _u_u_c_i_c_o (8) daemon on the remote system.

       The -_n and -_m switches do not  work  when  transferring  a
       file from one remote system to another.

       File  modes are not preserved, except for the execute bit.
       The resulting file is owned by the uucp user.
