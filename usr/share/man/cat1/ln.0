     The llnn utility creates a new directory entry (linked file) which inherits
     the same modes as the orginal file.  It is useful for maintaining
     multiple copies of a file in many places at once - without the `copies';
     instead, a link `points' to the original copy.  There are two types of
     links; hard links and symbolic links.  How a link `points' to a file is
     one of the differences between a hard or symbolic link.

     Option available:

     --ss    Create a symbolic link.

     By default llnn makes _h_a_r_d links.  A hard link to a file is
     indistinguishable from the original directory entry; any changes to a
     file are effective independent of the name used to reference the file.
     Hard links may not refer to directories (unless the proper incantations
     are supplied) and may not span file systems.

     A symbolic link contains the name of the file to which it is linked.  The
     referenced file is used when an open(2) operation is performed on the
     link.  A stat(2) on a symbolic link will return the linked-to file; an
     lstat(2) must be done to obtain information about the link.  The
     readlink(2) call may be used to read the contents of a symbolic link.
     Symbolic links may span file systems and may refer to directories.

     Given one or two arguments, llnn creates a link to an existing file
     _s_o_u_r_c_e__f_i_l_e. If _t_a_r_g_e_t__f_i_l_e is given, the link has that name; _t_a_r_g_e_t__f_i_l_e
     may also be a directory in which to place the link; otherwise it is
     placed in the current directory.  If only the directory is specified, the
     link will be made to the last component of _s_o_u_r_c_e__f_i_l_e.

     Given more than two arguments, llnn makes links in _t_a_r_g_e_t__d_i_r to all the
     named source files.  The links made will have the same name as the files
     being linked to.
