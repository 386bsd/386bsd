     LLaasstt will list the sessions of specified _u_s_e_r_s, _t_t_y_s, and _h_o_s_t_s, in re-
     verse time order.  Each line of output contains the user name, the tty
     from which the session was conducted, any hostname, the start and stop
     times for the session, and the duration of the session.  If the session
     is still continuing or was cut short by a crash or shutdown, llaasstt will so
     indicate.

     --ff _f_i_l_e     LLaasstt reads the file _f_i_l_e instead of the default,
                 /_v_a_r/_l_o_g/_w_t_m_p.

     --_n          Limits the report to _n lines.

     --tt _t_t_y      Specify the _t_t_y. Tty names may be given fully or abbreviated,
                 for example, ``last -t 03'' is equivalent to ``last -t
                 tty03''.

     --hh _h_o_s_t     _H_o_s_t names may be names or internet numbers.

     If multiple arguments are given, the information which applies to any of
     the arguments is printed, e.g., ``last root -t console'' would list all
     of ``root's'' sessions as well as all sessions on the console terminal.
     If no users, hostnames or terminals are specified, llaasstt prints a record
     of all logins and logouts.

     The pseudo-user _r_e_b_o_o_t logs in at reboots of the system, thus ``last
     reboot'' will give an indication of mean time between reboot.

     If llaasstt is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search has pro-
     gressed.  If interrupted with a quit signal llaasstt indicates how far the
     search has progressed and then continues.
