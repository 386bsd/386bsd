     The mmeessgg utility is invoked by a user to control write access others have
     to her or his terminal.  By default, write access is allowed, and pro-
     grams such as talk(1),  write(1) and echo(1) may display messages on the
     target user's terminal.

     Options available:

     nn     Disallows messages and informs the sender that `Your party is re-
           fusing messages'.

     yy     Allows messages to be displayed.

     If no arguments are given, mmeessgg displays the present message status.

     The mmeessgg utility exits with one of the following values:

            0    Messages are allowed.
            1    Messages are not allowed.
           -1    An error has occurred.
