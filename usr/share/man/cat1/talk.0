     TTaallkk is a visual communication program which copies lines from your ter-
     minal to that of another user.

     Options available:

     _p_e_r_s_o_n   If you wish to talk to someone on your own machine, then _p_e_r_s_o_n
              is just the person's login name.  If you wish to talk to a user
              on another host, then _p_e_r_s_o_n is of the form `user@host'.

     _t_t_y_n_a_m_e  If you wish to talk to a user who is logged in more than once,
              the _t_t_y_n_a_m_e argument may be used to indicate the appropriate
              terminal name, where _t_t_y_n_a_m_e is of the form `ttyXX'.

     When first called, ttaallkk sends the message
           Message from TalkDaemon@his_machine...
           talk: connection requested by your_name@your_machine.
           talk: respond with: talk your_name@your_machine

     to the user you wish to talk to. At this point, the recipient of the mes-
     sage should reply by typing

           talk  your_name@your_machine

     It doesn't matter from which machine the recipient replies, as long as
     his login-name is the same.  Once communication is established, the two
     parties may type simultaneously, with their output appearing in separate
     windows.  Typing control-L `^L' will cause the screen to be reprinted,
     while your erase, kill, and word kill characters will behave normally.
     To exit, just type your interrupt character; ttaallkk then moves the cursor
     to the bottom of the screen and restores the terminal to its previous
     state.

     Permission to talk may be denied or granted by use of the mesg(1) com-
     mand.  At the outset talking is allowed.  Certain commands, in particular
     nroff(1) and pr(1),  disallow messages in order to prevent messy output.

FFIILLEESS
     /etc/hosts     to find the recipient's machine
     /var/run/utmp  to find the recipient's tty

     mail(1),  mesg(1),  who(1),  write(1)

     The version of talk(1) released with 4.3BSD uses a protocol that is in-
     compatible with the protocol used in the version released with 4.2BSD.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ttaallkk command appeared in 4.2BSD.
