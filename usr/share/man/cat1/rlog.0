       _R_l_o_g prints information about RCS files.  Files ending  in
       `,v'  are  RCS  files,  all others are working files. If a
       working file is given, _r_l_o_g tries to find the  correspond-
       ing RCS file first in directory ./RCS and then in the cur-
       rent directory, as explained in _c_o(1L).

       _R_l_o_g prints the following information for each  RCS  file:
       RCS  file  name, working file name, head (i.e., the number
       of the latest revision  on  the  trunk),  default  branch,
       access  list,  locks, symbolic names, suffix, total number
       of revisions, number of revisions selected  for  printing,
       and  descriptive text. This is followed by entries for the
       selected revisions in reverse chronological order for each
       branch.  For  each  revision, _r_l_o_g prints revision number,
       author, date/time, state, number  of  lines  added/deleted
       (with  respect  to  the  previous revision), locker of the
       revision (if any), and log message.  Without options, _r_l_o_g
       prints  complete  information.  The options below restrict
       this output.

       --LL        ignores RCS files that have no locks set; conve-
                 nient in combination with --RR, --hh, or --ll.

       --RR        only prints the name of the RCS file; convenient
                 for translating a working file name into an  RCS
                 file name.

       --hh        prints  only  RCS  file name, working file name,
                 head, default branch, access list,  locks,  sym-
                 bolic names, and suffix.

       --tt        prints  the  same  as  --hh,  plus the descriptive
                 text.

       --bb        prints information about the  revisions  on  the
                 default  branch  (normally the highest branch on
                 the trunk).

       --dd_d_a_t_e_s   prints  information  about  revisions   with   a
                 checkin  date/time  in  the  ranges given by the
                 semicolon-separated list of _d_a_t_e_s.  A  range  of
                 the  form  _d_1<_d_2  or _d_2>_d_1 selects the revisions
                 that were deposited between _d_1 and  _d_2,  (inclu-
                 sive).  A range of the form <_d or _d> selects all
                 revisions dated _d or earlier.  A  range  of  the
                 form  _d<  or >_d selects all revisions dated _d or

                 later.  A range of the form _d selects  the  sin-
                 gle,  latest  revision  dated _d or earlier.  The
                 date/time strings _d, _d_1, and _d_2 are in the  free
                 format explained in _c_o(1L).  Quoting is normally
                 necessary, especially for < and >. Note that the
                 separator is a semicolon.

       --ll[_l_o_c_k_e_r_s]
                 prints  information  about locked revisions.  If
                 the comma-separated list _l_o_c_k_e_r_s of login  names
                 is given, only the revisions locked by the given
                 login names are printed.  If the list  is  omit-
                 ted, all locked revisions are printed.

       --rr_r_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_s
                 prints  information about revisions given in the
                 comma-separated list _r_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_s of revisions  and
                 ranges.  A  range _r_e_v_1-_r_e_v_2 means revisions _r_e_v_1
                 to _r_e_v_2 on the same branch, -_r_e_v means revisions
                 from  the  beginning  of  the  branch  up to and
                 including _r_e_v, and _r_e_v- means revisions starting
                 with  _r_e_v  to  the  end of the branch containing
                 _r_e_v. An argument that  is  a  branch  means  all
                 revisions  on  that  branch. A range of branches
                 means all revisions  on  the  branches  in  that
                 range.

       --ss_s_t_a_t_e_s  prints  information  about revisions whose state
                 attributes match one of the states given in  the
                 comma-separated list _s_t_a_t_e_s.

       --ww[_l_o_g_i_n_s]
                 prints information about revisions checked in by
                 users with login names appearing in  the  comma-
                 separated  list  _l_o_g_i_n_s.   If _l_o_g_i_n_s is omitted,
                 the user's login is assumed.

       _R_l_o_g prints the intersection  of  the  revisions  selected
       with  the  options  --dd,  --ll,  --ss, --ww, intersected with the
       union of the revisions selected by --bb and --rr.

               rlog  -L  -l  RCS/*,v

       The first command prints the names of all RCS files in the
       subdirectory  `RCS'  which  have locks. The second command
       prints the headers of those files, and  the  third  prints
       the headers plus the log messages of the locked revisions.
       The last command prints complete information.
