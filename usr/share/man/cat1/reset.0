     TTsseett initializes terminals.  TTsseett first determines the type of terminal
     that you are using.  This determination is done as follows, using the
     first terminal type found.

           oo   The _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l argument specified on the command line.
           oo   The value of the TERM environmental variable.
           oo   The terminal type associated with the standard error output
               device in the /_e_t_c/_t_t_y_s file.
           oo   The default terminal type, ``unknown''.

     If the terminal type was not specified on the command-line, the --mm option
     mappings are then applied (see below for more information).  Then, if the
     terminal type begins with a question mark (``?''), the user is prompted
     for confirmation of the terminal type.  An empty response confirms the
     type, or, another type can be entered to specify a new type.  Once the
     terminal type has been determined, the termcap entry for the terminal is
     retrieved.  If no termcap entry is found for the type, the user is
     prompted for another terminal type.

     Once the termcap entry is retrieved, the window size, backspace,
     interrupt and line kill characters (among many other things) are set and
     the terminal and tab initialization strings are sent to the standard
     error output.  Finally, if the erase, interrupt and line kill characters
     have changed, or are not set to their default values, their values are
     displayed to the standard error output.

     When invoked as rreesseett, ttsseett sets cooked and echo modes, turns off cbreak
     and raw modes, turns on newline translation and resets any unset special
     characters to their default values before doing the terminal
     initialization described above.  This is useful after a program dies
     leaving a terminal in a abnormal state.  Note, you may have to type
     ``<LF>reset<LF>'' (the line-feed character is normally control-J) to get
     the terminal to work, as carriage-return may no longer work in the
     abnormal state.  Also, the terminal will often not echo the command.

     The options are as follows:

     --     The terminal type is displayed to the standard output, and the
           terminal is not initialized in any way.

     --ee    Set the erase character to _c_h.

     --II    Do not send the terminal or tab initialization strings to the
           terminal.

     --ii    Set the interrupt character to _c_h.

     --kk    Set the line kill character to _c_h.

     --mm    Specify a mapping from a port type to a terminal.  See below for
           more information.

     --rr    Print the terminal type to the standard error output.

     --ss    Print the sequence of shell commands to initialize the environment

           variables TERM and TERMCAP to the standard output.

     --QQ    Don't display any values for the erase, interrupt and line kill
           characters.

     The arguments for the --ee, --ii and --kk options may either be entered as
     actual characters or by using the ``hat'' notation, i.e. control-h may be
     specified as ``^H'' or ``^h''.

     It is often desirable to set the terminal type and information about the
     terminal's capabilities in the shell's environment.  This is done with
     the --ss option; when this option is specified, the commands to enter the
     information into the shell's environment are output to the standard
     output.  If the SHELL environmental variable ends in ``csh'', the output
     commands are for the csh(1),  otherwise, they are for sh(1).  Note, the
     output commands for the ccsshh set and unset the shell variable ``noglob''.
     The following line in the ._l_o_g_i_n or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e files will initialize the
     environment correctly:

           eval `tset -s options ... `

     When the terminal is not hardwired into the system (or the current system
     information is incorrect) the terminal type derived from the /_e_t_c/_t_t_y_s
     file or the TERM environmental variable is often something generic like
     ``network'', ``dialup'', or ``unknown''. When ttsseett is used in a startup
     script (._p_r_o_f_i_l_e for sh(1) users or ._l_o_g_i_n for csh(1) users) it is often
     desirable to provide information about the type of terminal used on such
     ports.  The purpose of the --mm option is to ``map'' from some set of
     conditions to a terminal type, that is, to tell ttsseett ``If I'm on this
     port at a particular speed, guess that I'm on that kind of terminal''.

     The argument to the --mm option consists of an optional port type, an
     optional operator, an optional baud rate specification, an optional colon
     (``:'') character and a terminal type.  The port type is a string
     (delimited by either the operator or the colon character).  The operator
     may be any combination of: ``>'', ``<'', ``@'', and ``!''; ``>'' means
     greater than, ``<'' means less than, ``@'' means equal to and ``!''
     inverts the sense of the test.  The baud rate is specified as a number
     and is compared with the speed of the standard error output (which should
     be the control terminal).  The terminal type is a string.

     If the terminal type is not specified on the command line, the --mm
     mappings are applied to the terminal type.  If the port type and baud
     rate match the mapping, the terminal type specified in the mapping
     replaces the current type.  If more than one mapping is specified, the
     first applicable mapping is used.

     For example, consider the following: ``dialup>9600:vt100''. The port type
     is ``dialup'', the operator is ``>'', the baud rate specification is
     ``9600'', and the terminal type is ``vt100''. The result of this mapping
     is to specify that if the terminal type is ``dialup'', and the baud rate
     is greater than 9600 baud, a terminal type of ``vt100'' will be used.

     If no port type is specified, the terminal type will match any port type,
     for example, ``-m dialup:vt100 -m :?xterm'' will cause any dialup port,
     regardless of baud rate, to match the terminal type ``vt100'', and any
     non-dialup port type to match the terminal type ``?xterm''. Note, because
     of the leading question mark, the user will be queried on a default port
     as to whether they are actually using an _x_t_e_r_m terminal.

     No whitespace characters are permitted in the --mm option argument.  Also,
     to avoid problems with metacharacters, it is suggested that the entire --mm
     option argument be placed within single quote characters, and that ccsshh
     users insert a backslash character (``\'') before any exclamation marks
     (``!'').

     The ttsseett command appeared in 3.0BSD.

     The --AA, --EE, --hh, --SS, --uu and --vv options have been deleted from the ttsseett
     utility.  None of them were documented in 4.3BSD and all are of limited
     utility at best.  The --aa, --dd and --pp options are similarly not documented
     or useful, but were retained as they appear to be in widespread use.  It
     is strongly recommended that any usage of these three options be changed
     to use the --mm option instead.  The --nn option remains, but has no effect.
     It is still permissible to specify the --ee, --ii and --kk options without
     arguments, although it is strongly recommended that such usage be fixed
     to explicitly specify the character.

     Executing ttsseett as rreesseett no longer implies the --QQ option.  Also, the
     interaction between the -- option and the _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l argument in some
     historic implementations of ttsseett has been removed.

     Finally, the ttsseett implementation has been completely redone (as part of
     the addition to the system of a IEEE Std1003.1-1988 (``POSIX'') compliant
     terminal interface) and will no longer compile on systems with older
     terminal interfaces.
