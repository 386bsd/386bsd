       rcsintro - introduction to RCS commands

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The   Revision   Control  System  (RCS)  manages  multiple
       revisions of  text  files.   RCS  automates  the  storing,
       retrieval,   logging,   identification,   and  merging  of
       revisions.  RCS  is  useful  for  text  that  is   revised
       frequently, for example programs, documentation, graphics,
       papers, form letters, etc.

       The basic user interface is extremely simple.  The  novice
       only  needs to learn two commands: _c_i(1L) and _c_o(1L).  _C_i,
       short for "check in", deposits the contents of a text file
       into  an  archival  file  called  an RCS file. An RCS file
       contains all revisions of a  particular  text  file.   _C_o,
       short  for  "check  out",  retrieves revisions from an RCS
       file.

       o      Storage and  retrieval  of  multiple  revisions  of
              text.  RCS  saves  all  old  revisions  in  a space
              efficient  way.   Changes  no  longer  destroy  the
              original,  because  the  previous  revisions remain
              accessible. Revisions can be retrieved according to
              ranges  of revision numbers, symbolic names, dates,
              authors, and states.

       o      Maintenance of a complete history of  changes.  RCS
              logs  all  changes automatically.  Besides the text
              of each revision, RCS stores the author,  the  date
              and time of check-in, and a log message summarizing
              the change.  The logging makes it easy to find  out
              what  happened  to  a  module,  without  having  to
              compare source listings or  having  to  track  down
              colleagues.

       o      Resolution  of  access  conflicts. When two or more
              programmers wish to modify the same  revision,  RCS
              alerts    the    programmers   and   prevents   one
              modification from corrupting the other.

       o      Maintenance  of  a  tree  of  Revisions.  RCS   can
              maintain  separate  lines  of  development for each
              module. It stores a tree structure that  represents
              the ancestral relationships among revisions.

       o      Merging  of  revisions and resolution of conflicts.
              Two separate lines of development of a  module  can
              be  coalesced  by  merging.  If the revisions to be
              merged affect the same sections of code, RCS alerts
              the user about the overlapping changes.

       o      Release and configuration control. Revisions can be
              assigned symbolic names  and  marked  as  released,
              stable,  experimental, etc.  With these facilities,
              configurations of modules can be  described  simply
              and directly.

       o      Automatic  identification  of  each  revision  with
              name, revision number, creation time, author,  etc.
              The  identification  is  like  a  stamp that can be
              embedded at an appropriate place in the text  of  a
              revision.   The  identification  makes it simple to
              determine which revisions of which modules make  up
              a given configuration.

       o      Minimization of secondary storage. RCS needs little
              extra   space   for   the   revisions   (only   the
              differences).   If   intermediate   revisions   are
              deleted, the corresponding  deltas  are  compressed
              accordingly.


       GGeettttiinngg SSttaarrtteedd wwiitthh RRCCSS

       Suppose  you  have  a  file f.c that you wish to put under
       control of RCS.  Invoke the check-in command

               ccii  ff..cc

       This command creates the RCS file f.c,v, stores  f.c  into
       it as revision 1.1, and deletes f.c.  It also asks you for
       a description. The description should be a synopsis of the
       contents of the file. All later check-in commands will ask
       you for a log entry, which should  summarize  the  changes
       that you made.

       Files  ending  in  ,v are called RCS files (`v' stands for
       `versions'), the others are called working files.  To  get
       back the working file f.c in the previous example, use the
       check-out command

               ccoo  ff..cc

       This command extracts the latest revision from  f.c,v  and
       writes it into f.c. You can now edit f.c and check it back
       in by invoking

               ccii  ff..cc

       _C_i  increments  the  revision  number  properly.   If   _c_i
       complains with the message

                 ci error: no lock set by <your login>

       then  your  system administrator has decided to create all

RCSINTRO(1L)                   1983                  RCSINTRO(1L)


       RCS files with the locking attribute set to  `strict'.  In
       this  case, you should have locked the revision during the
       previous check-out. Your last check-out should have been

               ccoo  --ll  ff..cc

       Of course, it is too late now to  do  the  check-out  with
       locking,  because you probably modified f.c already, and a
       second  check-out  would  overwrite  your   modifications.
       Instead, invoke

               rrccss  --ll  ff..cc

       This command will lock the latest revision for you, unless
       somebody else got ahead of  you  already.  In  this  case,
       you'll have to negotiate with that person.

       Locking  assures  that you, and only you, can check in the
       next update, and avoids nasty problems if  several  people
       work  on  the same file.  Even if a revision is locked, it
       can still be checked out for reading, compiling, etc.  All
       that  locking  prevents  is  a CHECK-IN by anybody but the
       locker.

       If your RCS file is private, i.e., if  you  are  the  only
       person  who  is going to deposit revisions into it, strict
       locking is not needed and you can turn it off.  If  strict
       locking  is turned off, the owner of the RCS file need not
       have a lock for check-in; all  others  still  do.  Turning
       strict locking off and on is done with the commands

               rrccss  --UU  ff..cc     and     rrccss  --LL  ff..cc

       If  you  don't want to clutter your working directory with
       RCS files,  create  a  subdirectory  called  RCS  in  your
       working  directory, and move all your RCS files there. RCS
       commands will look  first  into  that  directory  to  find
       needed  files. All the commands discussed above will still
       work, without any modification.  (Actually, pairs  of  RCS
       and working files can be specified in 3 ways: (a) both are
       given, (b) only the working file is given,  (c)  only  the
       RCS  file  is  given.  Both RCS and working files may have
       arbitrary  path  prefixes;  RCS  commands  pair  them   up
       intelligently).

       To  avoid the deletion of the working file during check-in
       (in case you want to continue editing), invoke

               ccii  --ll  ff..cc     or     ccii  --uu  ff..cc

       These commands check in  f.c  as  usual,  but  perform  an
       implicit  check-out. The first form also locks the checked
       in revision, the second one doesn't. Thus,  these  options
       save  you  one  check-out  operation.   The  first form is

RCSINTRO(1L)                   1983                  RCSINTRO(1L)


       useful if locking is strict, the second one if not strict.
       Both  update  the  identification  markers in your working
       file (see below).

       You can give _c_i the number you want assigned to a  checked
       in  revision. Assume all your revisions were numbered 1.1,
       1.2, 1.3, etc., and you would like  to  start  release  2.
       The command

               ccii  --rr22  ff..cc     or     ccii  --rr22..11  ff..cc

       assigns the number 2.1 to the new revision.  From then on,
       _c_i will number the subsequent  revisions  with  2.2,  2.3,
       etc. The corresponding _c_o commands

               ccoo  --rr22  ff..cc     and     ccoo  --rr22..11  ff..cc

       retrieve the latest revision numbered 2.x and the revision
       2.1, respectively. _C_o without a  revision  number  selects
       the  latest  revision  on  the  "trunk", i.e., the highest
       revision with a number consisting  of  2  fields.  Numbers
       with  more  than  2  fields  are needed for branches.  For
       example, to start a branch at revision 1.3, invoke

               ccii  --rr11..33..11  ff..cc

       This command starts a branch numbered 1 at  revision  1.3,
       and  assigns  the  number 1.3.1.1 to the new revision. For
       more information about branches, see _r_c_s_f_i_l_e(5L).

       RCS can put special strings for identification  into  your
       source  and  object  code.  To obtain such identification,
       place the marker

               $Header$

       into your text, for instance inside a comment.   RCS  will
       replace this marker with a string of the form

               $Header:   filename   revision_number   date  time
       author  state $

       With such a marker on the first page of each  module,  you
       can  always  see with which revision you are working.  RCS
       keeps the markers up to date automatically.  To  propagate
       the  markers  into  your object code, simply put them into
       literal character strings. In C, this is done as follows:

               static char rcsid[] = "$Header$";

       The command _i_d_e_n_t extracts such  markers  from  any  file,

       even object code and dumps.  Thus, _i_d_e_n_t lets you find out
       which revisions of which modules  were  used  in  a  given
       program.

       You  may  also find it useful to put the marker $Log$ into
       your text, inside a comment. This marker  accumulates  the
       log  messages  that  are requested during check-in.  Thus,
       you  can  maintain  the  complete  history  of  your  file
       directly   inside   it.    There  are  several  additional
       identification markers; see _c_o(1L) for details.
