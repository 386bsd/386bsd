     ssccrriipptt - make typescript of terminal session

     ssccrriipptt [--aa] [_f_i_l_e]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     SSccrriipptt makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is
     useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive session
     as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out
     later with lpr(1).

     If the argument _f_i_l_e is given, ssccrriipptt saves all dialogue in _f_i_l_e. If no
     file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file _t_y_p_e_s_c_r_i_p_t.

     Option:

     --aa      Append the output to _f_i_l_e or _t_y_p_e_s_c_r_i_p_t, retaining the prior
             contents.

     The script ends when the forked shell exits (a _c_o_n_t_r_o_l-_D to exit the
     Bourne shell (sh(1)),  and _e_x_i_t, _l_o_g_o_u_t or _c_o_n_t_r_o_l-_d (if _i_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f is not
     set) for the C-shell, csh(1)).

     Certain interactive commands, such as vi(1),  create garbage in the
     typescript file.  SSccrriipptt works best with commands that do not manipulate
     the screen, the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     The following environment variable is utilized by ssccrriipptt:

     SHELL  If the variable SHELL exists, the shell forked by ssccrriipptt will be
            that shell. If SHELL is not set, the Bourne shell is assumed.
            (Most shells set this variable automatically).

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     csh(1) (for the _h_i_s_t_o_r_y mechanism).

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ssccrriipptt command appeared in 3.0BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     SSccrriipptt places eevveerryytthhiinngg in the log file, including linefeeds and
     backspaces.  This is not what the naive user expects.
