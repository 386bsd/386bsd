     TTffttpp is the user interface to the Internet TFTP (Trivial File Transfer
     Protocol), which allows users to transfer files to and from a remote ma-
     chine.  The remote _h_o_s_t may be specified on the command line, in which
     case ttffttpp uses _h_o_s_t as the default host for future transfers (see the
     ccoonnnneecctt command below).

     Once ttffttpp is running, it issues the prompt and recognizes the following
     commands:

     ?? _c_o_m_m_a_n_d-_n_a_m_e ...
              Print help information.

     aasscciiii    Shorthand for "mode ascii"

     bbiinnaarryy   Shorthand for "mode binary"

     ccoonnnneecctt _h_o_s_t-_n_a_m_e [_p_o_r_t]
              Set the _h_o_s_t (and optionally _p_o_r_t) for transfers.  Note that the
              TFTP protocol, unlike the FTP protocol, does not maintain con-
              nections betweeen transfers; thus, the ccoonnnneecctt command does not
              actually create a connection, but merely remembers what host is
              to be used for transfers.  You do not have to use the ccoonnnneecctt
              command; the remote host can be specified as part of the ggeett or
              ppuutt commands.

     ggeett _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
     ggeett _r_e_m_o_t_e_n_a_m_e _l_o_c_a_l_n_a_m_e
     ggeett _f_i_l_e_1 _f_i_l_e_2 ... _f_i_l_e_N
              Get a file or set of files from the specified _s_o_u_r_c_e_s. _S_o_u_r_c_e
              can be in one of two forms: a filename on the remote host, if
              the host has already been specified, or a string of the form
              _h_o_s_t_s:_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e to specify both a host and filename at the same
              time.  If the latter form is used, the last hostname specified
              becomes the default for future transfers.

     mmooddee _t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r-_m_o_d_e
              Set the mode for transfers; _t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r-_m_o_d_e may be one of _a_s_c_i_i or
              _b_i_n_a_r_y. The default is _a_s_c_i_i.

     ppuutt _f_i_l_e
     ppuutt _l_o_c_a_l_f_i_l_e _r_e_m_o_t_e_f_i_l_e
     ppuutt _f_i_l_e_1 _f_i_l_e_2 ... _f_i_l_e_N _r_e_m_o_t_e-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Put a file or set of files to the specified remote file or di-
              rectory.  The destination can be in one of two forms: a filename
              on the remote host, if the host has already been specified, or a
              string of the form _h_o_s_t_s:_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e to specify both a host and
              filename at the same time.  If the latter form is used, the
              hostname specified becomes the default for future transfers.  If
              the remote-directory form is used, the remote host is assumed to
              be a UNIX machine.

     qquuiitt     Exit ttffttpp. An end of file also exits.

BBUUGGSS
     Because there is no user-login or validation within the TFTP protocol,
     the remote site will probably have some sort of file-access restrictions
     in place.  The exact methods are specific to each site and therefore dif-
     ficult to document here.
