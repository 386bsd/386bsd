     The uunniiqq utility reads an input file or the standard input comparing ad-
     jacent lines, and writes one copy of each input line on the output.  The
     second and succeeding copies of repeated adjacent input lines are not
     written.  Repeated lines in the input are not detected if they are not
     adjacent, so it is important to sort(1) the files first.

     The following options are available:

     --cc      Precede each output line with a count of the number of times the
             line occurred in the input. For example:

                   duplicate_count line_number

             where the duplicate count is a blank padded field of up to four
             digits followed by a space.

     --dd      Suppress the writing of lines that are not repeated in the input.

     --ff _f_i_e_l_d_s
             Ignore the first fields on each input line when doing compar-
             isons, where fields is a positive decimal integer.  A field is a
             string of non-blank characters separated from adjacent fields by
             blanks.

     --ss _c_h_a_r_s
             Ignore the first chars characters when doing comparisons, where
             chars is a positive decimal integer.  If specified in conjunction
             with the --ff option, the first chars characters after the first
             fields fields will be ignored.

     --uu      Suppress the writing of lines that are repeated in the input.

     --_n      (Deprecated; replaced by --ff). Ignore the first n fields on each
             input line when doing comparisons, where n is a number.  A field
             is a string of non-blank characters separated from adjacent
             fields by blanks.

     ++_n      (Deprecated; replaced by --ss). Ignore the first _m characters when
             doing comparisons, where _m is a number.

     The following operands are available:

     _i_n_p_u_t__f_i_l_e    A pathname of the input file.  If the _i_n_p_u_t__f_i_l_e operand is
                   not specified, the standard input is used.

     _o_u_t_p_u_t__f_i_l_e   A pathname of the output file.  This name shall always be
                   different from _i_n_p_u_t__f_i_l_e. If the _o_u_t_p_u_t__f_i_l_e operand is
                   not specified, the standard output is used.  If _o_u_t_p_u_t__f_i_l_e
                   is created and an error occurs or a sugnal is caught the
                   _o_u_t_p_u_t__f_i_l_e is not removed.


     The uniq utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The uniq utility is expected to be IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'') compatible.
