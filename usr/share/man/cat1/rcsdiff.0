       _R_c_s_d_i_f_f runs _d_i_f_f(1) to compare two revisions of each  RCS
       file  given.   A  file  name ending in ',v' is an RCS file
       name, otherwise a working file name. _R_c_s_d_i_f_f  derives  the
       working  file  name from the RCS file name and vice versa,
       as explained in _c_o(1L).  Pairs consisting of both  an  RCS
       and a working file name may also be specified.

       The  options  --bb, --ii, --ww, --tt, --cc, --ee, --ff, and --hh, have the
       same effect as described in _d_i_f_f(1); option  --nn  generates
       an  edit  script of the format used by RCS.  The option --qq
       suppresses diagnostic output.

       If both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 are omitted,  _r_c_s_d_i_f_f  compares  the
       latest  revision  on  the  default  branch  (normally  the
       highest branch on the trunk)  with  the  contents  of  the
       corresponding working file. This is useful for determining
       what you changed since the last checkin.

       If _r_e_v_1 is given, but _r_e_v_2 is  omitted,  _r_c_s_d_i_f_f  compares
       revision  _r_e_v_1  of  the  RCS file with the contents of the
       corresponding working file.

       If  both  _r_e_v_1  and  _r_e_v_2  are  given,  _r_c_s_d_i_f_f   compares
       revisions _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 of the RCS file.

       Both   _r_e_v_1   and   _r_e_v_2   may  be  given  numerically  or
       symbolically, and may actually be attached to any  of  the
       options.

       The command

               rrccssddiiffff  ff..cc

       runs  _d_i_f_f on the latest revision on the default branch of
       RCS file f.c,v and the contents of working file f.c.

       The exit status is 0 if there were no  differences  during
       the last comparison, 1 if there were differences, and 2 if
       there were errors.
