       _R_c_s_d_i_f_f runs _d_i_f_f(1) to compare two revisions of each  RCS
       file  given.   A  file  name ending in ',v' is an RCS file
       name, otherwise a working file name. _R_c_s_d_i_f_f  derives  the
       working  file  name from the RCS file name and vice versa,
       as explained in _c_o(1L).  Pairs consisting of both  an  RCS
       and a working file name may also be specified.

       The  options  --bb, --ii, --ww, --tt, --cc, --ee, --ff, and --hh, have the
       same effect as described in _d_i_f_f(1); option  --nn  generates
       an  edit  script of the format used by RCS.  The option --qq
       suppresses diagnostic output.

       If both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 are omitted,  _r_c_s_d_i_f_f  compares  the
       latest  revision on the default branch (normally the high-
       est branch on the trunk) with the contents of  the  corre-
       sponding working file. This is useful for determining what
       you changed since the last checkin.

       If _r_e_v_1 is given, but _r_e_v_2 is  omitted,  _r_c_s_d_i_f_f  compares
       revision  _r_e_v_1  of  the  RCS file with the contents of the
       corresponding working file.

       If both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 are given,  _r_c_s_d_i_f_f  compares  revi-
       sions _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 of the RCS file.

       Both  _r_e_v_1  and  _r_e_v_2 may be given numerically or symboli-
       cally, and may actually be attached to any of the options.

       The command

               rrccssddiiffff  ff..cc

       runs  _d_i_f_f on the latest revision on the default branch of
       RCS file f.c,v and the contents of working file f.c.

       The exit status is 0 if there were no  differences  during
       the last comparison, 1 if there were differences, and 2 if
       there were errors.
