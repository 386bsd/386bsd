     The rmdir utility removes the directory entry specified by each _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
     argument, provided it is empty.

     Arguments are processed in the order given.  In order to remove both a
     parent directory and a subdirectory of that parent, the subdirectory must
     be specified first so the parent directory is empty when rrmmddiirr tries to
     remove it.

     The rrmmddiirr utility exits with one of the following values: Each directory
     entry specified by a dir operand referred to an empty directory and was
     removed successfully.  An error occurred.
