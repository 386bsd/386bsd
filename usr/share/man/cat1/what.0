     wwhhaatt - show what versions of object modules were used to construct a file

     wwhhaatt _n_a_m_e ...

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     WWhhaatt reads each file _n_a_m_e and searches for sequences of the form ``@(#)''
     as inserted by the source code control system.  It prints the remainder
     of the string following this marker, up to a null character, newline,
     double quote, or ``> character.''

BBUUGGSS
     As BSD UNIX is not licensed to distribute SCCS this is a rewrite of the
     wwhhaatt command which is part of SCCS, and may not behave exactly the same
     as that command does.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The wwhhaatt command appeared in 4.0BSD.
