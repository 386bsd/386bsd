     CChhppaassss allows editing of the user database information associated with
     _u_s_e_r or, by default, the current user.  The information is formatted and
     supplied to an editor for changes.

     Only the information that the user is allowed to change is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      The super-user is allowed to directly supply a user database
             entry, in the format specified by passwd(5),  as an argument.
             This argument must be a colon (``:'') separated list of all the
             user database fields, although they may be empty.

     --ss      The --ss option attempts to change the user's shell to _n_e_w_s_h.

     Possible display items are as follows:

           Login:           user's login name
           Password:        user's encrypted password
           Uid:             user's id
           Gid:             user's login group id
           Change:          password change time
           Expire:          account expiration time
           Class:           user's general classification
           Home Directory:  user's home directory
           Shell:           user's login shell
           Full Name:       user's real name
           Location:        user's normal location
           Home Phone:      user's home phone
           Office Phone:    user's office phone

     The _l_o_g_i_n field is the user name used to access the computer account.

     The _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d field contains the encrypted form of the user's password.

     The _u_i_d field is the number associated with the _l_o_g_i_n field.  Both of
     these fields should be unique across the system (and often across a group
     of systems) as they control file access.

     While it is possible to have multiple entries with identical login names
     and/or identical user id's, it is usually a mistake to do so.  Routines
     that manipulate these files will often return only one of the multiple
     entries, and that one by random selection.

     The _g_r_o_u_p field is the group that the user will be placed in at login.
     Since this system supports multiple groups (see groups(1))  this field
     currently has little special meaning.  This field may be filled in with
     either a number or a group name (see group(5)).

     The _c_h_a_n_g_e field is the date by which the password must be changed.

     The _e_x_p_i_r_e field is the date on which the account expires.

     Both the _c_h_a_n_g_e and _e_x_p_i_r_e fields should be entered in the form ``month
     day year'' where _m_o_n_t_h is the month name (the first three characters are
     sufficient), _d_a_y is the day of the month, and _y_e_a_r is the year.

     The _c_l_a_s_s field is currently unused.  In the near future it will be a key
     to a termcap(5) style database of user attributes.

     The user's _h_o_m_e _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is the full UNIX path name where the user will
     be placed at login.

     The _s_h_e_l_l field is the command interpreter the user prefers.  If the
     _s_h_e_l_l field is empty, the Bourne shell, /_b_i_n/_s_h, is assumed.  When
     altering a login shell, and not the super-user, the user may not change
     from a non-standard shell or to a non-standard shell.  Non-standard is
     defined as a shell not found in /_e_t_c/_s_h_e_l_l_s.

     The last four fields are for storing the user's _f_u_l_l _n_a_m_e, _o_f_f_i_c_e
     _l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n, and _h_o_m_e and _w_o_r_k _t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_e numbers.

     Once the information has been verified, cchhppaassss uses pwd_mkdb(8) to update
     the user database.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     The vi(1) editor will be used unless the environment variable EDITOR is
     set to an alternate editor.  When the editor terminates, the information
     is re-read and used to update the user database itself.  Only the user,
     or the super-user, may edit the information associated with the user.
