     WWhhiicchh takes a list of names and looks for the files which would be
     executed had these names been given as commands.  Each argument is
     expanded if it is aliased, and searched for along the user's path.  Both
     aliases and path are taken from the user's ._c_s_h_r_c file.

FFIILLEESS
     ~/.cshrc  source of aliases and path values

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     A diagnostic is given for names which are aliased to more than a single
     word, or if an executable file with the argument name was not found in
     the path.

BBUUGGSS
     Must be executed by a csh(1),  or some other shell which knows about
     aliases.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The wwhhiicchh command appeared in 3.0BSD.
