     The iidd utility displays the user and group names and numeric IDs, of the
     calling process, to the standard output.  If the real and effective IDs
     are different both are displayed, otherwise only the real ID is
     displayed.

     If a _u_s_e_r (login name or user ID) is specified, the user and group IDs of
     that user are displayed.  In this case, the real and effective IDs are
     assumed to be the same.

     The options are as follows:

     --GG      Display all of the different group IDs (effective, real and
             supplementary) as white-space separated numbers.

     --gg      Display only the effective group ID as a number.

     --nn      Display the name of the user or group ID instead of the number.

     --rr      Display the real ID instead of the effective ID.

     --uu      Display only the effective user ID as a number.

     If any of the ID numbers cannot be mapped into names, the number is
     displayed instead.

     The historic groups(1) command is equivalent to: iidd --GGnn [_u_s_e_r].

     The iidd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
