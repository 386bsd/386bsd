     The symbol table (name list) of each object in _f_i_l_e(_s) is displayed.  If
     a library (archive) is given, nnmm displays a list for each object archive
     member.  If _f_i_l_e is not present, nnmm searches for the file _a._o_u_t and if
     present, displays the symbol table for _a._o_u_t.

     --aa    Display symbol table entries inserted for use by debuggers.

     --gg    Restrict display to external (global) symbols.

     --nn    Present results in numerical order.

     --oo    Display full path or library name of object on every line.

     --pp    Do not sort at all.

     --rr    Reverse order sort.

     --uu    Display undefined symbols only.

     --ww    Warn about non-object archive members.  Normally, nm will silently
           ignore all archive members which are not object files.

     Each symbol name is preceded by its value (a blank field if the symbol is
     undefined) and one of the following letters:

           --       debugger symbol table entries (see the --aa option).
           A       absolute
           B       bss segment symbol
           C       common symbol
           D       data segment symbol
           f       file name
           T       text segment symbol
           U       undefined

     If the symbol is local (non-external) the type letter is in lower case.
     The output is sorted alphabetically.
