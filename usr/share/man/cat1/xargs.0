       xargs - construct argument list(s) and execute utility.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The _x_a_r_g_s utility reads space, tab,  newline  and  end-of-
       file  delimited arguments from the standard input and exe-
       cutes the specified _u_t_i_l_i_t_y with them as arguments.

       The utility and any arguments  specified  on  the  command
       line  are  given to the _u_t_i_l_i_t_y upon each invocation, fol-
       lowed by some number of the arguments read  from  standard
       input.   The _u_t_i_l_i_t_y is repeatedly executed until standard
       input is exhausted.

       Spaces, tabs and newlines may  be  embedded  in  arguments
       using  single  (`` ' '') or double (``"'') quotes or back-
       slashes (``\'').   Single  quotes  escape  all  non-single
       quote  characters,  excluding newlines, up to the matching
       single quote.  Double quotes escape all  non-double  quote
       characters,  excluding newlines, up to the matching double
       quote.  Any single character, including newlines,  may  be
       escaped by a backslash.

       The options are as follows:

       -f     Force  _x_a_r_g_s  to ignore the exit status returned by
              _u_t_i_l_i_t_y.  By default, _x_a_r_g_s will  exit  immediately
              if _u_t_i_l_i_t_y exits with a non-zero exit status.  This
              does not include ignoring _u_t_i_l_i_t_y exiting due to  a
              signal or without calling _e_x_i_t(2).

       -n number
              Set  the  maximum  number  of  arguments taken from
              standard input for each invocation of the  utility.
              An  invocation of _u_t_i_l_i_t_y will use less than _n_u_m_b_e_r
              standard input arguments if  the  number  of  bytes
              accumulated  (see the -_s option) exceeds the speci-
              fied _s_i_z_e or there are fewer than _n_u_m_b_e_r  arguments
              remaining  for the last invocation of _u_t_i_l_i_t_y.  The
              current default value for _n_u_m_b_e_r is 5000.

       -s size
              Set the maximum number of  bytes  for  the  command
              line  length  provided  to _u_t_i_l_i_t_y.  The sum of the
              length of the utility name and the arguments passed
              to  _u_t_i_l_i_t_y  (including  NULL  terminators) will be
              less than or equal to  this  number.   The  current
              default value for _s_i_z_e is ARG_MAX - 2048.

       -t     Echo  the  command to be executed to standard error

              immediately before it is executed.

       -x     Force _x_a_r_g_s to terminate immediately if  a  command
              line  containing  _n_u_m_b_e_r  arguments will not fit in
              the specified (or default) command line length.

       If no _u_t_i_l_i_t_y is specified, _e_c_h_o(1) is used.

       Undefined behavior may occur if  _u_t_i_l_i_t_y  reads  from  the
       standard input.

       _X_a_r_g_s  exits  with an exit status of 0 if no error occurs.
       If _u_t_i_l_i_t_y cannot be invoked, is terminated by a signal or
       terminates  without  calling  _e_x_i_t(2), _x_a_r_g_s exits with an
       exit status of 127.  If _u_t_i_l_i_t_y exits with an exit  status
       other  than  0, _x_a_r_g_s exits with that exit status.  Other-
       wise, _x_a_r_g_s exits with an exit status of 1.

       The _x_a_r_g_s utility is expected to be POSIX  1003.2  compli-
