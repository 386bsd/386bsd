     PPaasssswwdd changes the user's Kerberos password.  First, the user is prompted
     for their current password.  If the current password is correctly typed,
     a new password is requested.  The new password must be entered twice to
     avoid typing errors.

     The new password should be at least six characters long and not purely
     alphabetic.  Its total length must be less than _PASSWORD_LEN (currently
     128 characters).  Numbers, upper case letters and meta characters are
     encouraged.

     Once the password has been verified, ppaasssswwdd communicates the new password
     information to the Kerberos authenticating host.

     --ll    This option causes the password to be updated only in the local
           password file, and not with the Kerberos database.  When changing
           only the local password, pwd_mkdb(8) is used to update the password
           databases.

     To change another user's Kerberos password, one must first run kinit(1)
     followed by passwd(1).  The super-user is not required to provide a
     user's current password if only the local password is modified.
