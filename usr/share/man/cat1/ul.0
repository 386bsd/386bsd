     uull - do underlining

     UUll reads the named files (or standard input if none are given) and
     translates occurrences of underscores to the sequence which indicates
     underlining for the terminal in use, as specified by the environment
     variable TERM. The file /_e_t_c/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p is read to determine the appropriate
     sequences for underlining.  If the terminal is incapable of underlining,
     but is capable of a standout mode then that is used instead.  If the
     terminal can overstrike, or handles underlining automatically, uull
     degenerates to cat(1).  If the terminal cannot underline, underlining is
     ignored.

     The following options are available:

     --ii      Underlining is indicated by a separate line containing
             appropriate dashes `-'; this is useful when you want to look at
             the underlining which is present in an nroff output stream on a
             crt-terminal.

     --tt _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l
             Overrides the terminal type specified in the environment with
             _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l.

     The following environment variable is used:

     TERM  The TERM variable is used to relate a tty device with its device
           capability description (see termcap(5)).  TERM is set at login
           time, either by the default terminal type specified in /_e_t_c/_t_t_y_s or
           as set during the login process by the user in their _l_o_g_i_n file
           (see setenv(1)).

BBUUGGSS
     Nroff usually outputs a series of backspaces and underlines intermixed
     with the text to indicate underlining.  No attempt is made to optimize
     the backward motion.

     The uull command appeared in 3.0BSD.
