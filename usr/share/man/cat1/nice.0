NNAAMMEE
     nniiccee - execute a Bourne shell command at a low scheduling

     nniiccee [--_n_u_m_b_e_r] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s]

     NNiiccee runs _c_o_m_m_a_n_d at a low priority.  (Think of low and slow).  If
     --_n_u_m_b_e_r is specified, and if it is greater than or equal to 10 (the de-
     fault), nniiccee will execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d at that priority.  The upper bound, or
     lowest priority that nniiccee will run a command is 20.  The lower bounds or
     higher priorities (integers less than 10) can only be requested by the
     super-user.  Negative numbers are expressed as ----_n_u_m_b_e_r.

     The returned exit status is the exit value from the command executed by
     nniiccee.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     A nniiccee command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.

BBUUGGSS
     NNiiccee is particular to sh(1).  If you use csh(1),  then commands executed
     with ``&'' are automatically immune to hangup signals while in the back-
     ground.

     NNiiccee is built into csh(1) with a slightly different syntax than described
     here.  The form `nice +10' nices to positive nice, and `nice -10' can be
     used by the super-user to give a process more of the processor.
