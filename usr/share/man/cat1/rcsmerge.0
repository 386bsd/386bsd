       _R_c_s_m_e_r_g_e incorporates the changes between _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 of
       an RCS file into the corresponding working file. If --pp  is
       given,  the  result  is  printed  on  the standard output,
       otherwise the result overwrites the working file.

       A file name ending in ',v' is an RCS file name,  otherwise
       a  working  file name. _M_e_r_g_e derives the working file name
       from the RCS file name and vice  versa,  as  explained  in
       _c_o(1L).   A  pair  consisting of both an RCS and a working
       file name may also be specified.

       _R_e_v_1 may not be omitted. If _r_e_v_2 is  omitted,  the  latest
       revision  on  the  default  branch  (normally  the highest
       branch on the trunk) is assumed.  Both _r_e_v_1 and  _r_e_v_2  may
       be given numerically or symbolically.

       _R_c_s_m_e_r_g_e  prints  a  warning  if  there  are overlaps, and
       delimits the overlapping regions as explained  in  _c_o  -_j.
       The  command  is  useful  for incorporating changes into a
       checked-out revision.

       Suppose you have released revision 2.8 of f.c. Assume fur-
       thermore  that  you  just completed revision 3.4, when you
       receive updates to release 2.8 from someone else.  To com-
       bine  the  updates to 2.8 and your changes between 2.8 and
       3.4, put the updates to 2.8 into file f.c and execute

               rrccssmmeerrggee  --pp  --rr22..88  --rr33..44  ff..cc  >>ff..mmeerrggeedd..cc

       Then examine f.merged.c.  Alternatively, if  you  want  to
       save  the updates to 2.8 in the RCS file, check them in as
       revision 2.8.1.1 and execute _c_o -_j:

               ccii  --rr22..88..11..11  ff..cc
               ccoo  --rr33..44  --jj22..88::22..88..11..11  ff..cc

       As another  example,  the  following  command  undoes  the
       changes  between  revision  2.4  and 2.8 in your currently
       checked out revision in f.c.

               rrccssmmeerrggee  --rr22..88  --rr22..44  ff..cc

       Note the order of the arguments,  and  that  f.c  will  be
       overwritten.
