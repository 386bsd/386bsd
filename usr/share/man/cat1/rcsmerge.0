       _R_c_s_m_e_r_g_e incorporates the changes between _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 of
       an RCS file into the corresponding working file. If --pp  is
       given,  the  result  is  printed  on  the standard output,
       otherwise the result overwrites the working file.

       A file name ending in ',v' is an RCS file name,  otherwise
       a  working  file name. _M_e_r_g_e derives the working file name
       from the RCS file name and vice  versa,  as  explained  in
       _c_o(1L).   A  pair  consisting of both an RCS and a working
       file name may also be specified.

       _R_e_v_1 may not be omitted. If _r_e_v_2 is  omitted,  the  latest
       revision  on  the  default  branch  (normally  the highest
       branch on the trunk) is assumed.  Both _r_e_v_1 and  _r_e_v_2  may
       be given numerically or symbolically.

       _R_c_s_m_e_r_g_e  prints  a  warning  if  there  are overlaps, and
       delimits the overlapping regions as explained  in  _c_o  -_j.
       The  command  is  useful  for incorporating changes into a
       checked-out revision.

       Suppose you have released  revision  2.8  of  f.c.  Assume
       furthermore that you just completed revision 3.4, when you
       receive updates to release  2.8  from  someone  else.   To
       combine  the  updates  to 2.8 and your changes between 2.8
       and 3.4, put the updates to 2.8 into file f.c and execute

               rrccssmmeerrggee  --pp  --rr22..88  --rr33..44  ff..cc  >>ff..mmeerrggeedd..cc

       Then examine f.merged.c.  Alternatively, if  you  want  to
       save  the updates to 2.8 in the RCS file, check them in as
       revision 2.8.1.1 and execute _c_o -_j:

               ccii  --rr22..88..11..11  ff..cc
               ccoo  --rr33..44  --jj22..88::22..88..11..11  ff..cc

       As another  example,  the  following  command  undoes  the
       changes  between  revision  2.4  and 2.8 in your currently
       checked out revision in f.c.

               rrccssmmeerrggee  --rr22..88  --rr22..44  ff..cc

       Note the order of the arguments,  and  that  f.c  will  be
       overwritten.
