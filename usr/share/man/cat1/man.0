     The mmaann utility displays the BSD UNIX manual pages entitled _n_a_m_e.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      Display all of the manual pages for a specified _s_e_c_t_i_o_n and _n_a_m_e
             combination.  (Normally, only the first manual page found is
             displayed.)

     --cc      Copy the manual page to the standard output instead of using
             more(1) to paginate it.  This is done by default if the standard
             output is not a terminal device.

     --hh      Display only the ``SYNOPSIS'' lines of the requested manual
             pages.

     --MM      Override the list of standard directories which mmaann searches for
             manual pages.  The supplied _p_a_t_h must be a colon (``:'')
             separated list of directories.  This search path may also be set
             using the environment variable MANPATH. The subdirectories to be
             searched as well as their search order is specified by the
             ``_subdir'' line in the mmaann configuration file.

     --mm      Augment the list of standard directories which mmaann searches for
             manual pages.  The supplied _p_a_t_h must be a colon (``:'')
             separated list of directories.  These directories will be
             searched before the standard directories or the directories
             specified using the --MM option or the MANPATH environment
             variable.

     --ww      List the pathnames of the manual pages which mmaann would display
             for the specified _s_e_c_t_i_o_n and _n_a_m_e combination.

     The optional _s_e_c_t_i_o_n restricts the directories that mmaann will search.  The
     mmaann configuration file (see man_conf(5))  specifies the possible _s_e_c_t_i_o_n
     values that are currently available.  If only a single argument is
     specified or if the first argument is not a valid section, mmaann assumes
     that the argument is the name of a manual page to be displayed.

     MACHINE   As some manual pages are intended only for use on certain
               architectures, mmaann searches certain directories applicable to
               the current machine.  Man's determination of the current
               machine type may be overridden by setting the environment
               variable MACHINE to the name of an architecture (see
               machine(1)).  Machine specific areas are checked before general
               areas.

     MANPATH   The standard search path used by mmaann may be overridden by
               specifying a path in the MANPATH environment variable.  The
               format of the path is a colon (``:'') separated list of
               directories.  The subdirectories to be searched as well as
               their search order is specified by the ``_subdir'' line in the
               mmaann configuration file.

     PAGER     Any value of the environment variable PAGER will be used
               instead of the standard pagination program more(1).

BBUUGGSS
     The on-line manual pages are, by necessity, forgiving toward stupid
     display devices, causing some manual pages to not be as good as their
     typeset counterparts.
