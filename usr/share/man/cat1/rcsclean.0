       _R_c_s_c_l_e_a_n  removes  working files that were checked out and
       never modified.  For each file  given,  _r_c_s_c_l_e_a_n  compares
       the  working  file and a revision in the corresponding RCS
       file. If it finds no difference, it  removes  the  working
       file,  and,  if  the  revision  was  locked by the caller,
       unlocks the revision.

       A file name ending in ',v' is an RCS file name,  otherwise
       a  working  file  name.  _R_c_s_c_l_e_a_n derives the working file
       name from the RCS file name and vice versa,  as  explained
       in  _c_o(1L).  Pairs consisting of both an RCS and a working
       file name may also be specified.

       _R_e_v specifies with which revision the working file is com-
       pared.   If  _r_e_v is omitted, _r_c_s_c_l_e_a_n compares the working
       file with the latest revision on the default branch  (nor-
       mally  the  highest  branch  on the trunk).  The option --qq
       suppresses diagnostics.

       _R_c_s_c_l_e_a_n is useful for "clean" targets in Makefiles.  Note
       that _r_c_s_d_i_f_f(1L) prints out the differences.  Also, _c_i(1L)
       normally asks whether to check in a file  if  it  was  not
       changed.

       The command

            rcsclean *.c *.h

       removes all working files ending in ".c" or ".h" that were
       not changed since their checkout.

       The exit status is 0 if there were no  differences  during
       the  last  comparison  or if the last working file did not
       exist, 1 if there were differences, and 2  if  there  were
       errors.
