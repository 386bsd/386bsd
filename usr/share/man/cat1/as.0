DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       GNU  aass  is really a family of assemblers.  If you use (or
       have used) the GNU  assembler  on  one  architecture,  you
       should  find  a fairly similar environment when you use it
       on another architecture.  Each version has much in  common
       with  the  others,  including  object  file  formats, most
       assembler  directives  (often   called   _p_s_e_u_d_o-_o_p_s)   and
       assembler syntax.

       For  information  on the syntax and pseudo-ops used by GNU
       aass, see `aass' entry in iinnffoo (or the manual  _U_s_i_n_g  _a_s:  _T_h_e
       _G_N_U _A_s_s_e_m_b_l_e_r).

       aass is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU
       C compiler ggcccc for use by the  linker  lldd.   Nevertheless,
       we've  tried to make aass assemble correctly everything that
       the native assembler would.  This doesn't mean  aass  always
       uses  the  same  syntax  as another assembler for the same
       architecture; for example, we know of several incompatible
       versions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.

       Each  time  you  run  aass  it  assembles exactly one source
       program.  The source program is made up  of  one  or  more
       files.  (The standard input is also a file.)

       If aass is given no file names it attempts to read one input
       file from the aass standard input, which  is  normally  your
       terminal.   You may have to type ccttll--DD to tell aass there is
       no more program to assemble.  Use  `----'  if  you  need  to
       explicitly  name  the  standard input file in your command
       line.

       aass may write warnings and error messages to  the  standard
       error  file  (usually  your  terminal).   This  should not
       happen  when  aass  is  run  automatically  by  a  compiler.
       Warnings  report  an assumption made so that aass could keep
       assembling a flawed program; errors report a grave problem
       that stops the assembly.

       Options may be in any order, and may be before, after,  or
       between   file   names.    The  order  of  file  names  is
       significant.

       `----' (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file
       explicitly, as one of the files for aass to assemble.

       Except for `----' any command line argument that begins with
       a hyphen (`--') is an  option.   Each  option  changes  the
       behavior  of aass.  No option changes the way another option
       works.  An option  is  a  `--'  followed  by  one  or  more
       letters;  the  case  of  the  letter  is  important.   All
       options are optional.

       The `--oo' option expects exactly one file name  to  follow.
       The  file  name may either immediately follow the option's
       letter (compatible with older assemblers) or it may be the
       next command argument (GNU standard).

       These two command lines are equivalent:
       aass  --oo  mmyy--oobbjjeecctt--ffiillee..oo  mmuummbbllee..ss
