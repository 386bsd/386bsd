     lleeaavvee - remind you when you have to leave

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     LLeeaavvee waits until the specified time, then reminds you that you have to
     leave.  You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual time,
     at the time, and every minute thereafter.  When you log off, lleeaavvee exits
     just before it would have printed the next message.

     Options:

     _h_h_m_m  The time of day is in the form _h_h_m_m where _h_h is a time in hours (on
           a 12 or 24 hour clock), and _m_m are minutes.  All times are convert-
           ed to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to be in the next 12 hours.

     ++     If the time is preceeded by `++', the alarm will go off in hours and
           minutes from the current time.

     If no argument is given, lleeaavvee prompts with "When do you have to leave?".
     A reply of newline causes lleeaavvee to exit, otherwise the reply is assumed
     to be a time.  This form is suitable for inclusion in a ._l_o_g_i_n or
     ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e.

     Leave ignores interrupts, quits, and terminates.  To get rid of it you
     should either log off or use `kill -9' giving its process id.
