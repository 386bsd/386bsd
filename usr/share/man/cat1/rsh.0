     RRsshh executes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d on _h_o_s_t.

     RRsshh copies its standard input to the remote command, the standard output
     of the remote command to its standard output, and the standard error of
     the remote command to its standard error.  Interrupt, quit and terminate
     signals are propagated to the remote command; rrsshh normally terminates
     when the remote command does.  The options are as follows:

     --KK    The --KK option turns off all Kerberos authentication.

     --dd    The --dd option turns on socket debugging (using setsockopt(2))  on
           the TCP sockets used for communication with the remote host.

     --kk    The --kk option causes rrsshh to obtain tickets for the remote host in
           _r_e_a_l_m instead of the remote host's realm as determined by
           krb_realmofhost(3).

     --ll    By default, the remote username is the same as the local username.
           The --ll option allows the remote name to be specified.  Kerberos au-
           thentication is used, and authorization is determined as in
           rlogin(1).

     --nn    The --nn option redirects input from the special device /_d_e_v/_n_u_l_l
           (see the _B_U_G_S section of this manual page).

     --xx    The --xx option turns on DES encryption for all data exchange.  This
           may introduce a significant delay in response time.

     If no _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified, you will be logged in on the remote host us-
     ing rlogin(1).

     Shell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on local ma-
     chine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote machine.
     For example, the command

           rsh otherhost cat remotefile >> localfile

     appends the remote file _r_e_m_o_t_e_f_i_l_e to the local file _l_o_c_a_l_f_i_l_e, while

           rsh otherhost cat remotefile ">>" other_remotefile

     appends _r_e_m_o_t_e_f_i_l_e to _o_t_h_e_r__r_e_m_o_t_e_f_i_l_e.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The rrsshh command appeared in 4.2BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     If you are using csh(1) and put a rrsshh in the background without redirect-
     ing its input away from the terminal, it will block even if no reads are
     posted by the remote command.  If no input is desired you should redirect
     the input of rrsshh to /_d_e_v/_n_u_l_l using the --nn option.

     You cannot run an interactive command (like rogue(6) or vi(1))  using
     rrsshh; use rlogin(1) instead.

     Stop signals stop the local rrsshh process only; this is arguably wrong, but
     currently hard to fix for reasons too complicated to explain here.
