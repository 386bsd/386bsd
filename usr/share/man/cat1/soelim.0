NNAAMMEE
     ssooeelliimm - eliminate .so's from nroff input

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     ssooeelliimm [_f_i_l_e ...]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     SSooeelliimm reads the specified files or the standard input and performs the
     textual inclusion implied by the nroff(1) directives of the form:

           .so somefile

     The directives need to appear at the beginning of input lines.  This is
     useful since programs such as tbl(1) do not normally do this; it allows
     the placement of individual tables in separate files to be run as a part
     of a large document.

     An argument consisting of a single minus `--' is taken to be a file name
     corresponding to the standard input.

     Note that inclusion can be suppressed by using `\'' instead of `\.', i.e.

           'so /usr/lib/tmac.s

     A sample usage of ssooeelliimm would be

           soelim exum?.n | tbl | nroff -ms | col | lpr

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     colcrt(1),  more(1)

BBUUGGSS
     The format of the source commands must involve no strangeness - exactly
     one blank must precede and no blanks follow the file name.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ssooeelliimm command appeared in 3.0BSD.
