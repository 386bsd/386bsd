     cchheecckknnrr - check nroff/troff files

     CChheecckknnrr checks a list of nroff(1) or troff(1) input files for certain
     kinds of errors involving mismatched opening and closing delimiters and
     unknown commands.  If no files are specified, cchheecckknnrr checks the standard
     input.

     Options:

     --aa      Add additional pairs of macros to the list of known macros.  This
             must be followed by groups of six characters, each group defining
             a pair of macros.  The six characters are a period, the first
             macro name, another period, and the second macro name.  For exam-
             ple, to define a pair .BS and .ES, use `-a.BS.ES'

     --cc      Define commands which would otherwise be complained about as un-
             defined.

     --ff      Request cchheecckknnrr to ignore `f' font changes.

     --ss      Ignore `\s' size changes.

     Delimeters checked are:

     1.   Font changes using \fx ... \fP.

     2.   Size changes using \sx ... \s0.

     3.   Macros that come in open ... close forms, for example, the .TS and
          .TE macros which must always come in pairs.

     CChheecckknnrr is intended for use on documents that are prepared with cchheecckknnrr
     in mind, much the same as lint(1).  It expects a certain document writing
     style for `\f' and `\s' commands, in that each `\fx' must be terminated
     with `\fP' and each `\sx' must be terminated with `\s0'. While it will
     work to directly go into the next font or explicitly specify the original
     font or point size, and many existing documents actually do this, such a
     practice will produce complaints from cchheecckknnrr. Since it is probably bet-
     ter to use the `\fP' and `\s0' forms anyway, you should think of this as
     a contribution to your document preparation style.

     CChheecckknnrr knows about the ms(7) and me(7) macro packages.

     Complaints about unmatched delimiters.  Complaints about unrecognized
     commands.  Various complaints about the syntax of commands.

BBUUGGSS
     There is no way to define a 1 character macro name using --aa.

     Does not correctly recognize certain reasonable constructs, such as con-
     ditionals.

     The cchheecckknnrr command appeared in 4.0BSD.
