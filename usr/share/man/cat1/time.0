NNAAMMEE
     ttiimmee - time command execution

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     ttiimmee [--ll] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ttiimmee utility executes and times _c_o_m_m_a_n_d by initiating a timer and
     passing the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to the shell.  After the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d finishes, ttiimmee
     writes to the standard error stream, (in seconds): the total time
     elapsed, time consumed by system overhead, and the time used to execute
     the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d process.

     Available options:

     --ll      The contents of the _r_u_s_a_g_e structure are printed as well.

     The csh(1) has its own and syntactically different builtin version of
     ttiimmee.. The command described here is available as /_b_i_n/_t_i_m_e to csh users.

BBUUGGSS
     The granularity of seconds on micro processors is crude and can result in
     times being reported for CPU usage which are too large by a second.
