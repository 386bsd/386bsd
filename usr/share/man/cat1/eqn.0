DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ggeeqqnn is a preprocessor for ggrrooffff for formatting equations.
       Normally,  it  should  be  invoked  using the --ee option of
       ggrrooffff.  The syntax is quite compatible with eeqqnn.  The out-
       put  of  ggeeqqnn cannot be processed with ddiittrrooffff; it must be
       processed with ggttrrooffff.  If no files are given on the  com-
       mand line, the standard input will be read.  A filename of
       -- will cause the standard input to be read.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --CC     Recognize ..EEQQ and ..EENN even when followed by a char-
              acter other than space or newline.

       --DD     Draw  fraction  bars  using the \\DD escape sequence,
              rather than with the \\ll  escape  sequence  and  the
              \\((rruu character.

       --NN     Don't   allow  newlines  within  delimiters.   This
              option allows ggeeqqnn to recover better  from  missing
              closing delimiters.

       --vv     Print the version number.

       --rr     Only one size reduction.

       --mm_n    The  minimum point-size is _n.  Geqn will not reduce
              the size of subscripts or superscripts to a smaller
              size than _n.

       --TT_d_e_v  The  output  is for device _d_e_v.  A macro whose name
              is the name of the output device  is  automatically
              defined with a value of 11.  Nothing else depends on
              what the output device is;  geqn  does  not  itself
              read font or device description files.  The default
              output device is @@DDEEVVIICCEE@@.

       --ff_F    This is equivalent to a ggffoonntt _F command.

       --ss_n    This is equivalent  to  a  ggssiizzee _n  command.   This
              option is deprecated.  Geqn will normally set equa-
              tions at whatever the current point  size  is  when
              the equation is encountered.

       --pp_n    This  says  that subscripts and superscripts should
              be _n points  smaller  than  the  surrounding  text.
              This option is deprecated.  Normally eqn makes sets
              subscripts and superscripts at 70% of the  size  of

UUSSAAGGEE
       Only  the  differences  between geqn and eqn are described
       here.

       Most of the new features of ggeeqqnn are based on TeX.   There
       are  some  references  to  the differences between TeX and
       ggeeqqnn below; these may safely be ignored if you do not know
       TeX.

   AAuuttoommaattiicc ssppaacciinngg
       ggeeqqnn  gives  each  component  of  an  equation a type, and
       adjusts the spacing between components  using  that  type.
       Possible types are:

       ordinary     an ordinary character such as 1 or _x;

       operator     a large operator such as the summation opera-
                    tor;

       binary       a binary operator such as +;

       relation     a relation such as =;

       opening      a opening bracket such as (;

       closing      a closing bracket such as );

       punctuation  a punctutation character such as ,;

       inner        a subformula contained within brackets;

       suppress     spacing  that  suppresses  automatic  spacing
                    adjustment.

       Components of an equation get a type in one of two ways.

       ttyyppee _t _e
              This  yields  an equation component that contains _e
              but that has type _t, where _t is one  of  the  types
              mentioned above.  For example, ttiimmeess is defined as

                     ttyyppee ""bbiinnaarryy"" \\((mmuu

              The name of the type doesn't have to be quoted, but
              quoting protects from macro expansion.

       cchhaarrttyyppee _t _t_e_x_t
              Unquoted groups of characters  are  split  up  into
              individual characters, and the type of each charac-
              ter is looked up; this changes  the  type  that  is
              stored for each character; it says that the charac-
              ters in _t_e_x_t from now on have type _t.  For example,

              tion whenever  they  subsequently  appeared  in  an
              equation.   The type _t can also be lleetttteerr or ddiiggiitt;
              in these cases cchhaarrttyyppee changes the  font  type  of
              the characters.  See the Fonts subsection.

   NNeeww pprriimmiittiivveess
       _e_1 ssmmaalllloovveerr _e_2
              This is similar to oovveerr; ssmmaalllloovveerr reduces the size
              of _e_1 and _e_2; it  also  puts  less  vertical  space
              between  _e_1  or  _e_2 and the fraction bar.  The oovveerr
              primitive corresponds to the TeX \\oovveerr primitive in
              display  styles;  ssmmaalllloovveerr corresponds to \\oovveerr in
              non-display styles.

       vvcceenntteerr _e
              This vertically centers _e about the math axis.  The
              math  axis  is  the  vertical  position about which
              characters such as + and - are centered; also it is
              the  vertical  position  used  for the bar of frac-
              tions.  For example, ssuumm is defined as

                     {{ ttyyppee ""ooppeerraattoorr"" vvcceenntteerr ssiizzee ++55 \\((**SS }}

       _e_1 aacccceenntt _e_2
              This sets _e_2 as an accent over _e_1.  _e_2  is  assumed
              to be at the correct height for a lowercase letter;
              _e_2 will be moved down according if _e_1 is taller  or
              shorter  than a lowercase letter.  For example, hhaatt
              is defined as

                     aacccceenntt {{ ""^^"" }}

              ddoottddoott, ddoott, ttiillddee, vveecc and ddyyaadd are  also  defined
              using the aacccceenntt primitive.

       _e_1 uuaacccceenntt _e_2
              This  sets _e_2 as an accent under _e_1.  _e_2 is assumed
              to be at the correct height for a character without
              a  descender;  _e_2  will  be  moved down if _e_1 has a
              descender.  uuttiillddee is pre-defined using uuaacccceenntt  as
              a tilde accent below the baseline.

       sspplliitt ""_t_e_x_t""
              This has the same effect as simply

                     _t_e_x_t

              but  _t_e_x_t is not subject to macro expansion because
              it is quoted; _t_e_x_t will be split up and the spacing
              between individual characters will be adjusted.

       nnoosspplliitt _t_e_x_t
              This has the same effect as

                     ""_t_e_x_t""

              but  because  _t_e_x_t is not quoted it will be subject
              to macro expansion; _t_e_x_t will not be split  up  and
              the  spacing between individual characters will not
              be adjusted.

       _e oopppprriimmee
              This is a variant of pprriimmee that acts as an operator
              on _e.  It produces a different result from pprriimmee in
              a case such as AA oopppprriimmee ssuubb 11: with oopppprriimmee the  11
              will  be  tucked  under the prime as a subscript to
              the AA (as is conventional in mathematical  typeset-
              ting), whereas with pprriimmee the 11 will be a subscript
              to the prime character.  The prcedence  of  oopppprriimmee
              is  the  same  as  that  of bbaarr and uunnddeerr, which is
              higher than that of everything  except  aacccceenntt  and
              uuaacccceenntt.   In  unquoted  text  a  '' that is not the
              first character will be treated like oopppprriimmee.

   CCuussttoommiizzaattiioonn
       The appearance of equations is controlled by a large  num-
       ber of parameters. These can be set using the sseett command.

       sseett _p _n
              This sets parameter _p to value _n ; _n is an integer.
              For example,

                     sseett xx__hheeiigghhtt 4455

              says  that  ggeeqqnn  should assume an x height of 0.45
              ems.

              Possible parameters are as follows.  Values are  in
              units  of  hundreths  of  an  em  unless  otherwise
              stated.  These  descriptions  are  intended  to  be
              expository rather than definitive.

              mmiinniimmuumm__ssiizzee            ggeeqqnn  will not set anything
                                      at  a  smaller   point-size
                                      than this.  The value is in
                                      points.

              ffaatt__ooffffsseett              The ffaatt primitive emboldens
                                      an equation by overprinting
                                      two copies of the  equation
                                      horizontally offset by this
                                      amount.

                                      words, it will overhang the
                                      numerator  and  denominator

                                      long.   Normally,  bbaarr   or
                                      uunnddeerr produces a line whose

                                      object to which it applies;

                                      character,  this  tends  to
                                      produce a line  that  looks

       ggeeqqnn normally uses at least two fonts to set an  equation:
       an  italic  font  for letters, and a roman font for every-
       thing else.  The existing ggffoonntt command changes  the  font
       that  is  used  as the italic font.  By default this is II.
       The font that is used as the roman  font  can  be  changed
       using the new ggrrffoonntt command.

       ggrrffoonntt _f
              Set the roman font to _f.

       The  iittaalliicc  primitive uses the current italic font set by
       ggffoonntt; the rroommaann primitive uses the current roman font set
       by  ggrrffoonntt.   There  is  also  a new ggbbffoonntt command, which
       changes the font used by the bboolldd primitive.  If you  only
       use the rroommaann, iittaalliicc and bboolldd primitives to changes fonts
       within an equation, you can change all the fonts  used  by
       your equations just by using ggffoonntt, ggrrffoonntt and ggbbffoonntt com-
       mands.

       You can control which characters are  treated  as  letters
       (and  therefore set in italics) by using the cchhaarrttyyppee com-
       mand described above.  A type of lleetttteerr will cause a char-
       acter  to  be  set  in  italic type.  A type of ddiiggiitt will
       cause a character to be set in roman type.
