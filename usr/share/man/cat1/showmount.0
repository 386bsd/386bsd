     SShhoowwmmoouunntt shows status information about the NFS server on _h_o_s_t. By de-
     fault it prints the names of all hosts that have NFS file systems mounted
     on the host. See _N_F_S: _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _F_i_l_e _S_y_s_t_e_m _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l _S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n, RFC

BBUUGGSS
     The mount daemon running on the server only has an idea of the actual
     mounts, since the NFS server is stateless.  SShhoowwmmoouunntt will only display
     the information as accurately as the mount daemon reports it.
