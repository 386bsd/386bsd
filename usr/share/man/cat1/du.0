     The dduu utility displays the file system block usage for each file
     argument and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each
     directory argument.  If no file is specified, the block usage of the
     hierarchy rooted in the current directory is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      Display an entry for each file in the file hierarchy.

     --kk      By default, dduu displays the number of blocks as returned by the
             stat(2) system call, i.e. 512-byte blocks.  If the --kk flag is
             specified, the number displayed is the number of 1024-byte
             blocks.  Partial numbers of blocks are rounded up.

     --ss      Display only the grand total for the specified files.

     --xx      Filesystem mount points are not traversed.

     If _f_i_l_e is a symbolic link referencing an existing file, the file
     referenced by the link is reported on instead of the link itself.

     Files having multiple hard links are counted (and displayed) a single
     time per dduu execution.
