     CCaalleennddaarr checks the current directory for a file named named _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r and
     displays lines that begin with either today's date or tomorrow's.  On
     Fridays, events on Friday through Monday are displayed.

     The following options are available:

     --aa      Process the ``calendar'' files of all users and mail the results
             to them.  This requires super-user privileges.

     A month and day should begin lines.  They may be entered in almost any
     format, either numeric or as character strings.  A single asterisk
     (``*'') matches every month.  A day without a month matches that day of
     every week.  A month without a day matches the first of that month.  Two
     numbers default to the month followed by the day.  Lines with leading
     tabs default to the last entered date, allowing multiple line specifica-
     tions for a single date.  By convention, dates followed by an asterisk
     are not fixed, i.e. change from year to year.

     The ``calendar'' file is preprocessed by cpp(1),  allowing the inclusion
     of shared files such as company holidays or meetings.  If the shared file
     is not referenced by a full pathname, cpp(1) searches in the current (or
     home) directory first, and then in the directory /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r.
     Empty lines and lines protected by the C commenting syntax (/* ... */)
     are ignored.

     Some possible calendar entries:

           #include  <calendar.usholiday>
           #include  <calendar.birthday>

           6/15      ... June 15 (if ambiguous, will default to month/day).
           Jun. 15   ... June 15.
           15 June   ... June 15.
           Thursday  ... Every Thursday.
           June      ... Every June 1st.
           15 *      ... 15th of every month.

                         yearly by the local system administrator so that rov-

     The ccaalleennddaarr program previously selected lines which had the correct date
     anywhere in the line.  This is no longer true, the date is only recog-
     nized when it occurs first on the line.

     A ccaalleennddaarr command appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.

     ``the last Monday in April''.
