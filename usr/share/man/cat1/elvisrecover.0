       elvrec  -  Recover  the modified version of a file after a

       If you're editing a  file  when  _e_l_v_i_s  dies,  the  system
       crashes,  or  power fails, the most recent version of your
       text will be preserved.  The preserved text is stored in a
       special  directory;  it  does NOT overwrite your text file
       automatically.

       The _e_l_v_r_e_c program locates  the  preserved  version  of  a
       given  file,  and writes it over the top of your text file
       -- or to a new file, if you prefer.   The  recovered  file
       will have nearly all of your changes.

       To see a list of all recoverable files, run _e_l_v_r_e_c with no
       arguments.

       /usr/preserve/p*
              The text that was preserved when _e_l_v_i_s died.

       /usr/preserve/Index
              A text file which lists the names of all  preserved
              files,  and the names of the /usr/preserve/p* files
              which contain their preserved text.

       _e_l_v_r_e_c is very picky about filenames.  You must tell it to
       recover  the  file using exactly the same pathname as when
       you were editing it.  The simplest way to do this is to go
       into  the same directory that you were editing, and invoke
       _e_l_v_r_e_c with the same filename as _e_l_v_i_s.  If  that  doesn't
       work,  then  try  running _e_l_v_r_e_c with no arguments, to see
       exactly which pathname it is using for the desired file.

       Due to the permissions on the /usr/preserve directory,  on
       UNIX  systems  _e_l_v_r_e_c  must  be run as superuser.  This is
       accomplished by making the _e_l_v_r_e_c executable be  owned  by
       "root" and setting its "set user id" bit.

       If  you're editing a nameless buffer when _e_l_v_i_s dies, then
       _e_l_v_r_e_c will pretend that the file was named "foo".
