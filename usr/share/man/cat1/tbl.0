       gtbl - table formatter for groff

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ggttbbll  is  a  preprocessor for ggrrooffff for formatting tables.
       Normally, it should be invoked  using  the  --tt  option  of
       ggrrooffff..  It is highly compatible with ttbbll.  The output gen-
       erated by ggttbbll cannot be processed with ddiittrrooffff;  it  must
       be  processed  with  ggttrrooffff.  If no files are given on the
       command line, the standard input will be read.  A filename
       of -- will cause the standard input to be read.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --CC     Recognize ..TTSS and ..TTEE even when followed by a char-
              acter other than space or newline.

       --vv     Print the version number.

UUSSAAGGEE
       Only the differences between ggttbbll and  ttbbll  are  described
       here.

       The  ff  format  modifier  can  be followed by an arbitrary
       length font name in parentheses.

       There is a dd format modifier which means that a vertically
       spanning  entry  should  be  aligned  at the bottom of its
       range.

       There is no limit on the number of columns in a table, nor
       any  limit on the number of text blocks.  All the lines of
       a table are considered in deciding column widths, not just
       the  first  200.   Table  continuation (..TT&&) lines are not
       restricted to the first 200 lines.

       Numeric and alphabetic items may appear in the  same  col-
       umn.

       Numeric and alphabetic items may span horizontally.

       ggttbbll  uses  register,  string,  macro  and diversion names
       beginning with 33.  When using ggttbbll you should avoid  using
       any names beginning with a 33.

BBUUGGSS
       You  should use ..TTSS HH/..TTHH for _a_l_l multi-page boxed tables.
       If there is no header that you wish to appear at  the  top
       of  each page of the table, place the ..TTHH line immediately
       after the format section.  Do  not  enclose  a  multi-page
       table  within  keep/release  macros,  or  divert it in any
       other way.

       A text block within a table must be able  to  fit  on  one
       page.
