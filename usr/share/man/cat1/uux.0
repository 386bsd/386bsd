       uux - Remote command execution over UUCP

       uuuuxx [ options ] command

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _u_u_x  command is used to execute a command on a remote
       system, or to execute a command on the local system  using
       files  from  remote  systems.  The command is not executed
       immediately; the request is queued until  the  _u_u_c_i_c_o  (8)
       daemon  calls  the  system and executes it.  The daemon is
       started automatically unless the --rr switch is given.

       The actual command execution is done by the _u_u_x_q_t (8) dae-
       mon.

       File  arguments can be gathered from remote systems to the
       execution system, as can standard input.  Standard  output
       may be directed to a file on a remote system.

       The command name may be preceded by a system name followed
       by an exclamation point if it  is  to  be  executed  on  a
       remote system.  An empty system name is taken as the local
       system.

       Each  argument  that  contains  an  exclamation  point  is
       treated as naming a file.  The system which the file is on
       is before the exclamation point, and the pathname on  that
       system  follows  it.  An empty system name is taken as the
       local system; this must be used to transfer a  file  to  a
       command being executed on a remote system.  If the path is
       not absolute, it will be appended to the  current  working
       directory on the local system; the result may not be mean-
       ingful on the remote system.  A pathname  may  begin  with
       ~/, in which case it is relative to the UUCP public direc-
       tory (usually /usr/spool/uucppublic)  on  the  appropriate
       system.   A  pathname may begin with ~name/, in which case
       it is relative to the home directory of the named user  on
       the appropriate system.

       Standard  input and output may be redirected as usual; the
       pathnames used may contain exclamation points to  indicate
       that  they  are on remote systems.  Note that the redirec-
       tion characters must be quoted so that they are passed  to
       _u_u_x rather than interpreted by the shell.  Append redirec-
       tion (>>) does not work.

       All specified files are gathered together  into  a  single
       directory  before  execution  of the command begins.  This
       means that each file must have a distinct base name.   For
       example,  uux  'sys1!diff  sys2!~user1/foo sys3!~user2/foo
       >!foo.diff' will fail because both files will be copied to
       sys1 and stored under the name foo.

       Arguments  may be quoted by parentheses to avoid interpre-
       tation of exclamation points.  This is useful when execut-
       ing the _u_u_c_p command on a remote system.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The following options may be given to _u_u_x.

       --,,--pp Read  standard input and use it as the standard input
            for the command to be executed.

       --cc   Do not copy local files to the spool directory.  This
            is  the  default.   If  they are removed before being
            processed by the _u_u_c_i_c_o (8)  daemon,  the  copy  will
            fail.   The  files must be readable by the _u_u_c_i_c_o (8)
            daemon, as well as the by the invoker of _u_u_x.

       --CC   Copy local files to the spool directory.

       --ll   Link local files into the spool directory.  If a file
            can  not  be  linked  because  it  is  on a different
            device, it will be copied unless the --cc  option  also
            appears  (in  other  words,  use  of  --ll switches the
            default from --cc to --CC))..  If  the  files  are  changed
            before  being processed by the _u_u_c_i_c_o (8) daemon, the
            changed versions will be used.   The  files  must  be
            readable  by the _u_u_c_i_c_o (8) daemon, as well as by the
            invoker of _u_u_x.

       --gg ggrraaddee
            Set the grade of the file transfer command.  Jobs  of
            a  higher grade are executed first.  Grades run 0 ...
            9 A ... Z a ... z from high to low.

       --nn   Do not send mail about the status of the job, even if
            it fails.

       --zz   Send  mail  about  the  status of the job if an error
            occurs.  For many _u_u_x_q_t daemons, including the Taylor
            UUCP _u_u_x_q_t, this is the default action; for those, --zz
            will have no effect.   However,  some  _u_u_x_q_t  daemons
            will  send  mail  if  the  job succeeds unless the --zz
            option is used, and some other _u_u_x_q_t daemons will not
            send  mail  if  the job fails unless the --zz option is
            used.

       --rr   Do not  start  the  _u_u_c_i_c_o  (8)  daemon  immediately;
            merely  queue up the execution request for later pro-
            cessing.

       --jj   Print jobids on standard output.   A  jobid  will  be
            generated  for  each  file copy operation required to
            perform the operation.  These file copies may be can-
            celled  by passing the jobid to the --kk switch of _u_u_s-
            _t_a_t (1), which will make the execution impossible  to

            complete.

       --aa aaddddrreessss
            Report job status to the specified e-mail address.

       --xx ttyyppee
            Turn  on  particular  debugging types.  The following
            types  are  recognized:  abnormal,  chat,  handshake,
            uucp-proto,  proto,  port, config, spooldir, execute,
            incoming, outgoing.  Only abnormal, config,  spooldir
            and execute are meaningful for _u_u_x.

            Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and
            the --xx option may appear multiple  times.   A  number
            may also be given, which will turn on that many types
            from the foregoing list; for example, --xx 22 is equiva-
            lent to --xx aabbnnoorrmmaall,,cchhaatt..

       --II ffiillee
            Set  configuration  file to use.  This option may not
            be available, depending upon how _u_u_x was compiled.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       uux -z - sys1!rmail  user1  Execute  the  command  ``rmail
       user1''  on  the  system sys1, giving it as standard input
       whatever is given to _u_u_x as standard input.  If a  failure
       occurs,  send  a  message  using  _m_a_i_l  (1).  uux 'diff -c
       sys1!~user1/file1 sys2!~user2/file2 >!file.diff' Fetch the
       two  named files from system sys1 and system sys2 and exe-
       cute _d_i_f_f putting the result in file.diff in  the  current
       directory.   The current directory must be writable by the
       _u_u_x_q_t  (8)  daemon  for  this  to  work.   uux  'sys1!uucp
       ~user1/file1 (sys2!~user2/file2)' Execute _u_u_c_p on the sys-
       tem sys1 copying file1 (on system  sys1)  to  sys2.   This
       illustrates the use of parentheses for quoting.

RREESSTTRRIICCTTIIOONNSS
       The  remote  system  may not permit you to execute certain
       commands.  Many remote systems only permit  the  execution
       of _r_m_a_i_l and _r_n_e_w_s.

       Some  of  the options are dependent on the capabilities of
       the _u_u_x_q_t (8) daemon on the remote system.

FFIILLEESS
       The file names may be changed at compilation  time  or  by
       the  configuration file, so these are only approximations.

       /usr/lib/uucp/config - Configuration file.
       /usr/spool/uucp - UUCP spool directory.
       /usr/spool/uucp/Log - UUCP log file.
       /usr/spool/uucppublic - Default UUCP public directory.

BBUUGGSS
       Files can not be referenced across multiple systems.

       Too many jobids are output by --jj,, and there is no good way
       to cancel a local execution requiring remote files.
