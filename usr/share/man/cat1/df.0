     ddff - display free disk space

     ddff [--iikknn] [_f_i_l_e | _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m ...]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     DDff displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the
     specified _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m or on the filesystem of which _f_i_l_e is a part.
     Values are displayed in 512-byte per block block counts, unless the --kk
     option is specified, or the BLOCKSIZE environment variable is set (see
     below).  If neither a file or a filesystem operand is specified,
     statistics for all mounted filesystems are displayed.

     The following options are available:

     --ii      Include statistics on the number of free inodes.

     --kk      The block counts are forced to be in 1K (1024 8-bit bytes) size
             blocks.

     --nn      Print out the previously obtained statistics from the
             filesystems.  This option should be used if it is possible that
             one or more filesystems are in a state such that they will not be
             able to provide statistics without a long delay.  When this
             option is specified, ddff will not request new statistics from the
             filesystems, but will respond with the possibly stale statistics
             that were previously obtained.

     BLOCKSIZE  If the environmental variable BLOCKSIZE is set, the block
                counts will be displayed in units of that size block.

     The --nn flag is ignored if a file or filesystem is specified.
