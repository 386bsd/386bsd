     ddff - display free disk space

     ddff [--iikknn] [_f_i_l_e | _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m ...]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     DDff displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the speci-
     fied _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m or on the filesystem of which _f_i_l_e is a part.  If neither
     a file or a filesystem operand is specified, statistics for all mounted
     filesystems are displayed.

     The following options are available:

     --ii      Include statistics on the number of free inodes.

     --kk      By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.  The
             --kk option causes the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.

     --nn      Print out the previously obtained statistics from the filesys-
             tems.  This option should be used if it is possible that one or
             more filesystems are in a state such that they will not be able
             to provide statistics without a long delay.  When this option is
             specified, ddff will not request new statistics from the filesys-
             tems, but will respond with the possibly stale statistics that
             were previously obtained.

BBUUGGSS
     The --nn flag is ignored if a file or filesystem is specified.
