     Programs have historically used a script (often named ``:yyfix'') to ex-
     tract tables from the yacc(1) generated file _y._t_a_b._c. As the names of the
     tables generated by the current version of yacc are different from those
     of historical versions of yacc,  the shell script yyyyffiixx is provided to
     simplify the transition.

     The first (and required) argument to yyyyffiixx is the name of the file where
     the extracted tables should be stored.

     If further command line arguments are specified, they are taken as the
     list of tables to be extracted.  Otherwise, yyyyffiixx attempts to determine
     if the _y._t_a_b._c file is from an old or new yacc,  and extracts the appro-
     priate tables.

     The tables ``yyexca'', ``yyact'', ``yypact'', ``yypgo'', ``yyr1'',
     ``yyr2'', ``yychk'', and ``yydef'' are extracted from historical versions
     of yacc.

     The tables ``yylhs'', ``yylen'', ``yydefred'', ``yydgoto'', ``yysindex'',
     ``yyrindex'', ``yygindex'', ``yytable'', ``yyname'', ``yyrule'', and
     ``yycheck'', are extracted from the current version of yacc.
