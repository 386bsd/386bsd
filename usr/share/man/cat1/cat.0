     The ccaatt utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard
     output.  The _f_i_l_e operands are processed in command line order.  A single
     dash represents standard input.

     The options are as follows:

     --bb      Implies the --nn option but doesn't number blank lines.

     --ee      Implies the --vv option, and displays a dollar sign (`$') at the
             end of each line as well.

     --nn      Number the _o_u_t_p_u_t lines, starting at 1.

     --ss      Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be
             single spaced.

     --tt      Implies the --vv option, and displays tab characters as (`^I') as
             well.

     --uu      The --uu option guarantees that the output is unbuffered.

     --vv      Displays non-printing characters so they are visible.  Control
             characters print line `^X' for control-X; the delete character
             (octal 0177) prints as `^?' Non-ascii characters (with the high
             bit set) are printed as `M-' (for meta) followed by the character
             for the low 7 bits.

     The ccaatt utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

BBUUGGSS
     Because of the shell language mechanism used to perform output redirec-
     tion, the command ``cat file1 file 2 > file1'' will cause the original
     data in file1 to be destroyed!
