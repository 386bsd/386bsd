       ggrrooppss translates the output of ggttrrooffff to PostScript.  Nor-
       mally ggrrooppss should invoked by using the groff command with
       a --TTppss option.  If no files are given, ggrrooppss will read the
       standard  input.  A filename of -- will also cause ggrrooppss to
       read the standard input.  PostScript output is written  to
       the standard output.

       ZapfDingbats (with symbols pointing in the opposite direc-
       tion)  is available as ZZDDRR; most characters in these fonts
       are unnamed and must be accessed using \\NN.

       ggrrooppss understands various X commands produced using the \\XX
       escape  sequence;  ggrrooppss will only interpret commands that
       begin with a ppss:: tag.

       \\XX''ppss:: eexxeecc _c_o_d_e''
              This executes the arbitrary PostScript commands  in
              _c_o_d_e.   The  PostScript currentpoint will be set to
              the position of the  \\XX  command  before  executing
              _c_o_d_e.  The origin will be at the top left corner of
              the page, and y coordinates will increase down  the
              page.   A procedure uu will be defined that converts
              groff units to the  coordinate  system  in  effect.
              For example,

                     ..nnrr xx 11ii
                     \\XX''ppss:: eexxeecc \\nnxx uu 00 rrlliinneettoo ssttrrookkee''

              will  draw  a  horizontal line one inch long.  _c_o_d_e
              may make changes to the  graphics  state,  but  any
              changes  will  persist only to the end of the page.
              Any definitions will also persist  only  until  the
              end of the page.  If you use the \\YY escape sequence
              with an argument  that  names  a  macro,  _c_o_d_e  can
              extend over multiple lines.  For example,

                     ..nnrr xx 11ii
                     ..ddee yy
                     ppss:: eexxeecc
                     \\nnxx uu 00 rrlliinneettoo
                     ssttrrookkee
                     ....
                     \\YYyy

              is  another  way to draw a horizontal line one inch
              long.

       \\XX''ppss:: ffiillee _n_a_m_e''
              This is the same as the eexxeecc  command  except  that
              the PostScript code is read from file _n_a_m_e.

       \\XX''ppss:: ddeeff _c_o_d_e''
              Place  a PostScript definition contained in _c_o_d_e in
              the prologue.  There should be at most one  defini-
              tion per \\XX command.  Long definitions can be split
              over several \\XX commands; all  the  _c_o_d_e  arguments
              are  simply  joined together separated by newlines.
              The definitions are placed in a dictionary which is
              automatically  pushed  on the dictionary stack when
              an eexxeecc command is executed.  If  you  use  the  \\YY
              escape  sequence  with  an  argument  that  names a
              macro, _c_o_d_e can extend over multiple lines.

       \\XX''ppss:: mmddeeff _n _c_o_d_e''
              Like ddeeff, except that _c_o_d_e  may  contain  up  to  _n

              definitions.   ggrrooppss needs to know how many defini-
              tions _c_o_d_e contains so that it can create  an  app-
              propriately  sized PostScript dictionary to contain
              them.

       \\XX''ppss:: iimmppoorrtt _f_i_l_e _l_l_x _l_l_y _u_r_x _u_r_y _w_i_d_t_h [ _h_e_i_g_h_t ]''
              Import a PostScript graphic from _f_i_l_e.   The  argu-
              ments  _l_l_x, _l_l_y, _u_r_x, and _u_r_y give the bounding box
              of the graphic in the default PostScript coordinate
              system;  they  should  all be integers; _l_l_x and _l_l_y
              are the x and  y  coordinates  of  the  lower  left
              corner  of the graphic; _u_r_x and _u_r_y are the x and y
              coordinates  of  the  upper  right  corner  of  the
              graphic;  _w_i_d_t_h  and  _h_e_i_g_h_t are integers that give
              the desired width and height in groff units of  the
              graphic.  The graphic will be scaled so that it has
              this width and height and translated  so  that  the
              lower  left corner of the graphic is located at the
              position associated with \\XX command.  If the height
              argument  is omitted it will be scaled uniformly in
              the x and y directions so that it has the specified
              width.   Note  that  the contents of the \\XX command
              are not interpreted by ggttrrooffff;  so  vertical  space
              for the graphic is not automatically added, and the
              _w_i_d_t_h and _h_e_i_g_h_t arguments are not allowed to  have
              attached  scaling  indicators.   If  the PostScript
              file complies with the Adobe  Document  Structuring
              Conventions  and  contains a %%%%BBoouunnddiinnggBBooxx comment,
              then  the  bounding  box   can   be   automatically
              extracted from within groff by using the ssyy request
              to run the ppssbbbb command.

              The --mmppss macros  (which  are  automatically  loaded
              when  ggrrooppss  is run by the groff command) include a
              PPSSPPIICC macro which allows a  picture  to  be  easily
              imported.  This has the format

                     ..PPSSPPIICC _f_i_l_e [_w_i_d_t_h [_h_e_i_g_h_t]]

              _f_i_l_e  is the name of the file containing the illus-
              tration; _w_i_d_t_h and _h_e_i_g_h_t give  the  desired  width
              and  height  of  the graphic.  The _w_i_d_t_h and _h_e_i_g_h_t
              arguments may have scaling indicators attached; the
              default  scaling  indicator  is ii.  This macro will
              scale the graphic uniformly in the x and  y  direc-
              tions  so  that  it  is no more than _w_i_d_t_h wide and
              _h_e_i_g_h_t high.

       The input to  ggrrooppss  must  be  in  the  format  output  by
       ggttrrooffff(@MAN1EXT@).       This      is     described     in
       ggrrooffff__oouutt(@MAN1EXT@).  In addition  the  device  and  font
       description  files  for  the device used must meet certain
       requirements.  The device and font description files  sup-
       plied   for   ppss   device  meet  all  these  requirements.

       aaffmmttooddiitt(@MAN1EXT@) can be used to create font files  from
       AFM  files.  The resolution must be an integer multiple of
       72 times the ssiizzeessccaallee.  The ppss device uses  a  resolution
       of  72000 and a sizescale of 1000.  The device description
       file should contain a command

              ppaappeerrlleennggtthh _n

       which says that output should be generated which is  suit-
       able  for  printing  on  a  page whose length is _n machine
       units.  Each font description file must contain a command

              iinntteerrnnaallnnaammee _p_s_n_a_m_e

       which says that the PostScript name of the font is _p_s_n_a_m_e.
       It may also contain a command

              eennccooddiinngg _e_n_c__f_i_l_e

       which  says  that  the PostScript font should be reencoded
       using the encoding described in _e_n_c__f_i_l_e; this file should
       consist of a sequence of lines of the form:

              _p_s_c_h_a_r _c_o_d_e

       where  _p_s_c_h_a_r is the PostScript name of the character, and
       _c_o_d_e is its position in the encoding expressed as a  deci-
       mal  integer.   The  code  for each character given in the
       font file must correspond to the code for the character in
       encoding  file, or to the code in the default encoding for
       the font if the PostScript font is not  to  be  reencoded.
       This  code  can  be  used  with  the \\NN escape sequence in
       ggttrrooffff to select the character, even if the character does
       not  have  a groff name.  Every character in the font file
       must exist in the PostScript font, and the widths given in
       the font file must match the widths used in the PostScript
       font.  ggrrooppss will assume that a  character  with  a  groff
       name  of  ssppaaccee  is blank (makes no marks on the page); it
       can make use of such a character to  generate  more  effi-
       cient and compact PostScript output.

       ggrrooppss  can  automatically  include  the downloadable fonts
       necessary to print the document.  Any  downloadable  fonts
       which  should, when required, be included by ggrrooppss must be
       listed in the file @@FFOONNTTDDIIRR@@//ddeevvppss//ddoowwnnllooaadd;  this  should
       consist of lines of the form

              _f_o_n_t  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

       where  _f_o_n_t  is the PostScript name of the font, and _f_i_l_e-
       _n_a_m_e is the name of the file containing  the  font;  lines
       beginning  with  ## and blank lines are ignored; fields may
       be separated by tabs or spaces; _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e will be  searched
       for  using  the same mechanism that is used for groff font

       metric files.  The  ddoowwnnllooaadd  file  itself  will  also  be
       searched for using this mechanism.

       If  a  file  imported  with the \\XX iimmppoorrtt command complies
       with the  Adobe  Document  Structuring  Conventions,  then
       ggrrooppss  will  include  any  fonts  that  are  needed by the
       imported file and are listed in the ddoowwnnllooaadd file.

       ggrrooppss is also able to handle inter-font dependencies.  Any
       downloadable  font that depends on another font must indi-
       cate this by following  the  Structuring  Conventions  and
       listing  the  fonts on which it depends in the %%%%DDooccuummeenntt--
       FFoonnttss comment.  For example, suppose that you have a down-
       loadable  font  called  Garamond,  and also a downloadable
       font called Garamond-Outline  which  depends  on  Garamond
       (typically  it  would  be  defined to copy Garamond's font
       dictionary, and change the PaintType), then the  download-
       able font file for Garamond-Outline should start like this

              %%!!PPSS--AAddoobbee--22..11
              %%%%DDooccuummeennttFFoonnttss:: GGaarraammoonndd

       ggrrooppss will then ensure that whenever  Garamond-Outline  is
       included,  Garamond  is  included before it.  In this case
       both Garamond and Garamond-Outline would need to be listed
       in  the  ddoowwnnllooaadd  file.   A downloadable font should list
       every font that it depends on even if that font  is  resi-
       dent in the printer (like, for example, Symbol); this will
       enable ggrrooppss to generate a correct %%%%DDooccuummeennttFFoonnttss comment
       for  its  output; the font should not include its own name
       in the %%%%DDooccuummeennttFFoonnttss comment.
