DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of ccppiioo.  ccppiioo
       copies files into or out of a cpio or tar  archive,  which
       is a file that contains other files plus information about
       them, such  as  their  pathname,  owner,  timestamps,  and
       access  permissions.   The  archive can be another file on
       the disk, a magnetic tape, or  a  pipe.   ccppiioo  has  three
       operating modes.

       In  copy-out  mode, ccppiioo copies files into an archive.  It
       reads a list of filenames, one per line, on  the  standard
       input, and writes the archive onto the standard output.  A
       typical way to generate the list of filenames is with  the
       ffiinndd  command;  you  should give ffiinndd the -depth option to
       minimize problems with permissions on directories that are
       unwritable or not searchable.

       In  copy-in  mode,  ccppiioo copies files out of an archive or
       lists the archive contents.  It reads the archive from the
       standard input.  Any non-option command line arguments are
       shell globbing patterns; only files in the  archive  whose
       names  match one or more of those patterns are copied from



                                                                1





CPIO(1L)                                                 CPIO(1L)


       the archive.  Unlike in the shell, an  initial  `.'  in  a
       filename  does match a wildcard at the start of a pattern,
       and a `/' in  a  filename  can  match  wildcards.   If  no
       patterns are given, all files are extracted.

       In  copy-pass  mode,  ccppiioo copies files from one directory
       tree to another, combining the copy-out and copy-in  steps
       without  actually  using an archive.  It reads the list of
       files to copy from the standard input; the directory  into
       which it will copy them is given as a non-option argument.

       ccppiioo supports the following archive formats:  binary,  old
       ASCII,  new  ASCII,  crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old
       tar, and POSIX.1  tar.   The  binary  format  is  obsolete
       because  it  encodes  information about the files in a way
       that   is   not   portable   between   different   machine
       architectures.   The  old ASCII format is portable between
       different machine architectures, but should not be used on
       file  systems with more than 65536 i-nodes.  The new ASCII
       format is portable between different machine architectures
       and  can  be  used  on  any  size  file system, but is not
       supported by all versions of ccppiioo; currently, it  is  only
       supported  by GNU and Unix System V R4.  The crc format is
       like the new ASCII format, but also  contains  a  checksum
       for  each  file  which  ccppiioo  calculates  when creating an
       archive and verifies when the file is extracted  from  the
       archive.   The HPUX formats are provided for compatibility
       with HPUX's cpio which stores device files differently.

       The tar format is provided for compatability with the  ttaarr
       program.   It  can not be used to archive files with names
       longer than 100 characters, and can not be used to archive
       "special" (block or character devices) files.  The POSIX.1
       tar format can not be used to  archive  files  with  names
       longer than 255 characters (less unless they have a "/" in
       just the right place).

       By default,  ccppiioo  creates  binary  format  archives,  for
       compatibility  with  older ccppiioo programs.  When extracting
       from archives, ccppiioo automatically recognizes which kind of
       archive  it  is  reading  and can read archives created on
       machines with a different byte-order.

       Some  of  the  options  to  ccppiioo  apply  only  to  certain
       operating  modes;  see  the SYNOPSIS section for a list of
       which options are allowed in which modes.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -_0, --_n_u_l_l
              In copy-out and copy-pass modes,  read  a  list  of
              filenames terminated by a null character instead of
              a  newline,  so  that  files  whose  names  contain
              newlines  can  be archived.  GNU ffiinndd is one way to
              produce a list of null-terminated filenames.



                                                                2

       -_a, --_r_e_s_e_t-_a_c_c_e_s_s-_t_i_m_e
              Reset the access times of files after reading them,
              so  that  it does not look like they have just been
              read.

       -_A, --_a_p_p_e_n_d
              Append to an existing archive.  Only works in copy-
              out   mode.   The  archive  must  be  a  disk  file
              specified with the -_O or -_F (--_f_i_l_e) option.

       -_b, --_s_w_a_p
              In copy-in mode, swap both halfwords of  words  and
              bytes of halfwords in the data.  Equivalent to -_s_S.
              Use this option to convert 32-bit integers  between
              big-endian and little-endian machines.

       -_B     Set  the  I/O  block size to 5120 bytes.  Initially
              the block size is 512 bytes.

       --_b_l_o_c_k-_s_i_z_e=_B_L_O_C_K-_S_I_Z_E
              Set the I/O block size to BLOCK-SIZE * 512 bytes.

       -_c     Use the old portable (ASCII) archive format.

       -_C _I_O-_S_I_Z_E, --_i_o-_s_i_z_e=_I_O-_S_I_Z_E
              Set the I/O block size to IO-SIZE bytes.

       -_d, --_m_a_k_e-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_i_e_s
              Create leading directories where needed.

       -_E _F_I_L_E, --_p_a_t_t_e_r_n-_f_i_l_e=_F_I_L_E
              In   copy-in   mode,   read   additional   patterns
              specifying  filenames to extract or list from FILE.
              The lines of FILE are treated as if they  had  been
              non-option arguments to ccppiioo.

       -_f, --_n_o_n_m_a_t_c_h_i_n_g
              Only  copy files that do not match any of the given
              patterns.

       -_F, --_f_i_l_e=_a_r_c_h_i_v_e
              Archive filename to use instead of  standard  input
              or  output.  To use a tape drive on another machine
              as the archive, use a  filename  that  starts  with
              `HOSTNAME:'.   The  hostname  can  be preceded by a
              username and an `@' to access the remote tape drive
              as  that  user,  if  you  have  permission to do so
              (typically an  entry  in  that  user's  `~/.rhosts'
              file).

       --_f_o_r_c_e-_l_o_c_a_l
              With  -_F,  -_I, or -_O, take the archive file name to
              be a local file even if it contains a colon,  which
              would ordinarily indicate a remote host name.



                                                                3

              Use  archive  format FORMAT.  The valid formats are
              listed below; the same names are also recognized in
              all-caps.   The  default  in  copy-in  mode  is  to
              automatically detect the  archive  format,  and  in
              copy-out mode is "bin".

              bin    The obsolete binary format.

              odc    The old (POSIX.1) portable format.

              newc   The   new   (SVR4)  portable  format,  which
                     supports file systems having more than 65536
                     i-nodes.

              crc    The   new  (SVR4)  portable  format  with  a
                     checksum added.

              tar    The old tar format.

              ustar  The POSIX.1 tar format.  Also recognizes GNU
                     ttaarr  archives,  which  are  similar  but not
                     identical.

              hpbin  The obsolete binary format  used  by  HPUX's
                     cpio     (which    stores    device    files
                     differently).

              hpodc  The portable  format  used  by  HPUX's  cpio
                     (which stores device files differently).

       -_i, --_e_x_t_r_a_c_t
              Run in copy-in mode.

       -_I _a_r_c_h_i_v_e
              Archive  filename to use instead of standard input.
              To use a tape  drive  on  another  machine  as  the
              archive,   use   a   filename   that   starts  with
              `HOSTNAME:'.  The hostname can  be  preceded  by  a
              username and an `@' to access the remote tape drive
              as that user, if  you  have  permission  to  do  so
              (typically  an  entry  in  that  user's `~/.rhosts'
              file).

       -_k     Ignored; for compatibility with other  versions  of
              ccppiioo.

       -_l, --_l_i_n_k
              Link  files instead of copying them, when possible.

       -_L, --_d_e_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              Dereference symbolic links  (copy  the  files  that
              they point to instead of copying the links).




                                                                4

              Retain   previous   file  modification  times  when
              creating files.

       -_M _M_E_S_S_A_G_E, --_m_e_s_s_a_g_e=_M_E_S_S_A_G_E
              Print MESSAGE when the  end  of  a  volume  of  the
              backup  media  (such as a tape or a floppy disk) is
              reached, to prompt the user to insert a new volume.
              If MESSAGE contains the string "%d", it is replaced
              by the current volume number (starting at 1).

       -_n, --_n_u_m_e_r_i_c-_u_i_d-_g_i_d
              In the verbose  table  of  contents  listing,  show
              numeric  UID  and  GID  instead of translating them
              into names.

        --_n_o-_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e-_o_w_n_e_r
              In copy-in mode and copy-pass mode, do  not  change
              the ownership of the files; leave them owned by the
              user extracting them.  This is the default for non-
              root  users,  so  that  users  on  System  V  don't
              inadvertantly give away files.

       -_o, --_c_r_e_a_t_e

              In  copy-out and copy-pass modes, set the ownership
              of all files created to the specified  user  and/or
              group.  Either the user or the group, or both, must
              be present.  If the group is omitted but the ":" or
              "."  separator is given, use the given user's login
              group.   Only  the  super-user  can  change  files'
