DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The tteellnneett command is used to communicate with another host using the
     TELNET protocol.  If tteellnneett is invoked without the _h_o_s_t argument, it
     enters command mode, indicated by its prompt (tteellnneett>>). In this mode, it
     accepts and executes the commands listed below.  If it is invoked with
     arguments, it performs an ooppeenn command with those arguments.

     Options:

     --dd      Sets the initial value of the ddeebbuugg toggle to TRUE

     --aa      Attempt automatic login.  Currently, this sends the user name via
             the USER variable of the ENVIRON option if supported by the
             remote system.  The name used is that of the current user as
             returned by getlogin(2) if it agrees with the current user ID,
             otherwise it is the name associated with the user ID.

     --nn _t_r_a_c_e_f_i_l_e
             Opens _t_r_a_c_e_f_i_l_e for recording trace information.  See the sseett
             ttrraacceeffiillee command below.

     --ll _u_s_e_r
             When connecting to the remote system, if the remote system
             understands the ENVIRON option, then _u_s_e_r will be sent to the
             remote system as the value for the variable USER.  This option
             implies the --aa option.  This option may also be used with the
             ooppeenn command.

     --ee _e_s_c_a_p_e _c_h_a_r
             Sets the initial tteellnneett tteellnneett escape character to _e_s_c_a_p_e _c_h_a_r.
             If _e_s_c_a_p_e _c_h_a_r is ommitted, then there will be no escape
             character.

     _h_o_s_t    Indicates the official name, an alias, or the Internet address of
             a remote host.

     _p_o_r_t    Indicates a port number (address of an application).  If a number
             is not specified, the default tteellnneett port is used.

     Once a connection has been opened, tteellnneett will attempt to enable the
     TELNET LINEMODE option.  If this fails, then tteellnneett will revert to one of
     two input modes: either ``character at a time'' or ``old line by line''
     depending on what the remote system supports.

     When LINEMODE is enabled, character processing is done on the local
     system, under the control of the remote system.  When input editing or
     character echoing is to be disabled, the remote system will relay that
     information.  The remote system will also relay changes to any special
     characters that happen on the remote system, so that they can take effect
     on the local system.

     In ``character at a time'' mode, most text typed is immediately sent to
     the remote host for processing.

     In ``old line by line'' mode, all text is echoed locally, and (normally)
     only completed lines are sent to the remote host.  The ``local echo
     character'' (initially ``^E'') may be used to turn off and on the local
     echo (this would mostly be used to enter passwords without the password
     being echoed).

     If the LINEMODE option is enabled, or if the llooccaallcchhaarrss toggle is TRUE
     (the default for ``old line by line``; see below), the user's qquuiitt, iinnttrr,
     and fflluusshh characters are trapped locally, and sent as TELNET protocol
     sequences to the remote side.  If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then
     the user's ssuusspp and eeooff are also sent as TELNET protocol sequences, and
     qquuiitt is sent as a TELNET ABORT instead of BREAK There are options (see
     ttooggggllee aauuttoofflluusshh and ttooggggllee aauuttoossyynncchh below) which cause this action to
     flush subsequent output to the terminal (until the remote host
     acknowledges the TELNET sequence) and flush previous terminal input (in
     the case of qquuiitt and iinnttrr).

     While connected to a remote host, tteellnneett command mode may be entered by
     typing the tteellnneett ``escape character'' (initially ``^]'').  When in
     command mode, the normal terminal editing conventions are available.

     The following tteellnneett commands are available.  Only enough of each command
     to uniquely identify it need be typed (this is also true for arguments to
     the mmooddee, sseett, ttooggggllee, uunnsseett, ssllcc, eennvviirroonn, and ddiissppllaayy commands).

     cclloossee      Close a TELNET session and return to command mode.

     ddiissppllaayy _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t ...
                Displays all, or some, of the sseett and ttooggggllee values (see
                below).

     mmooddee _t_y_p_e  _T_y_p_e is one of several options, depending on the state of the
                TELNET session.  The remote host is asked for permission to go
                into the requested mode.  If the remote host is capable of
                entering that mode, the requested mode will be entered.

                cchhaarraacctteerr     Disable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the
                              remote side does not understand the LINEMODE
                              option, then enter ``character at a time`` mode.

                lliinnee          Enable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the
                              remote side does not understand the LINEMODE
                              option, then attempt to enter ``old-line-by-
                              line`` mode.

                iissiigg (--iissiigg)  Attempt to enable (disable) the TRAPSIG mode of
                              the LINEMODE option.  This requires that the
                              LINEMODE option be enabled.

                eeddiitt (--eeddiitt)  Attempt to enable (disable) the EDIT mode of the
                              LINEMODE option.  This requires that the
                              LINEMODE option be enabled.

                ssooffttttaabbss (--ssooffttttaabbss)
                              Attempt to enable (disable) the SOFT_TAB mode of
                              the LINEMODE option.  This requires that the
                              LINEMODE option be enabled.

                lliitteecchhoo (--lliitteecchhoo)
                              Attempt to enable (disable) the LIT_ECHO mode of
                              the LINEMODE option.  This requires that the
                              LINEMODE option be enabled.

                ??             Prints out help information for the mmooddee
                              command.

     ooppeenn _h_o_s_t [[--ll] _u_s_e_r][--_p_o_r_t]
                Open a connection to the named host.  If no port number is
                specified, tteellnneett will attempt to contact a TELNET server at
                the default port.  The host specification may be either a host
                name (see hosts(5))  or an Internet address specified in the
                ``dot notation'' (see inet(3)).  The [--ll] option may be used
                to specify the user name to be passed to the remote system via
                the ENVIRON option.  When connecting to a non-standard port,
                tteellnneett omits any automatic initiation of TELNET options.  When
                the port number is preceeded by a minus sign, the inital
                option negotiation is done.  After establishing a connection,
                the file ._t_e_l_n_e_t_r_c in the users home directory is opened.
                Lines begining with a # are comment lines.  Blank lines are
                ignored.  Lines that begin without whitespace are the start of
                a machine entry.  The first thing on the line is the name of
                the machine that is being connected to.  The rest of the line,
                and successive lines that begin with whitespace are assumed to
                be tteellnneett commands and are processed as if they had been typed
                in manually to the tteellnneett command prompt.

     qquuiitt       Close any open TELNET session and exit tteellnneett. An end of file
                (in command mode) will also close a session and exit.

     sseenndd _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s
                Sends one or more special character sequences to the remote
                host.  The following are the arguments which may be specified
                (more than one argument may be specified at a time):

                aabboorrtt   Sends the TELNET ABORT (Abort processes) sequence.

                aaoo      Sends the TELNET AO (Abort Output) sequence, which
                        should cause the remote system to flush all output
                        _f_r_o_m the remote system _t_o the user's terminal.

                aayytt     Sends the TELNET AYT (Are You There) sequence, to
                        which the remote system may or may not choose to
                        respond.

                bbrrkk     Sends the TELNET BRK (Break) sequence, which may have
                        significance to the remote system.

                eecc      Sends the TELNET EC (Erase Character) sequence, which
                        should cause the remote system to erase the last
                        character entered.

                eell      Sends the TELNET EL (Erase Line) sequence, which
                        should cause the remote system to erase the line
                        currently being entered.

                eeooff     Sends the TELNET EOF (End Of File) sequence.

                eeoorr     Sends the TELNET EOR (End of Record) sequence.

                eessccaappee  Sends the current tteellnneett escape character (initially
                        ``^'').

                ggaa      Sends the TELNET GA (Go Ahead) sequence, which likely
                        has no significance to the remote system.

                ggeettssttaattuuss
                        If the remote side supports the TELNET STATUS command,
                        ggeettssttaattuuss will send the subnegotiation to request that
                        the server send its current option status.

                iipp      Sends the TELNET IP (Interrupt Process) sequence,
                        which should cause the remote system to abort the
                        currently running process.


                nnoopp     Sends the TELNET NOP (No OPeration) sequence.

                ssuusspp    Sends the TELNET SUSP (SUSPend process) sequence.

                ssyynncchh   Sends the TELNET SYNCH sequence.  This sequence causes
                        the remote system to discard all previously typed (but
                        not yet read) input.  This sequence is sent as TCP
                        urgent data (and may not work if the remote system is
                        a 4.2BSD system -- if it doesn't work, a lower case
                        ``r'' may be echoed on the terminal).

                ??       Prints out help information for the sseenndd command.

     sseett _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _v_a_l_u_e

     uunnsseett _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _v_a_l_u_e
                The sseett command will set any one of a number of tteellnneett
                variables to a specific value or to TRUE. The special value
                ooffff turns off the function associated with the variable, this
                is equivalent to using the uunnsseett command.  The uunnsseett command
                will disable or set to FALSE any of the specified functions.
                The values of variables may be interrogated with the ddiissppllaayy
                command.  The variables which may be set or unset, but not
                toggled, are listed here.  In addition, any of the variables
                for the ttooggggllee command may be explicitly set or unset using
                the sseett and uunnsseett commands.

                eecchhoo    This is the value (initially ``^E'') which, when in
                        ``line by line'' mode, toggles between doing local
                        echoing of entered characters (for normal processing),
                        and suppressing echoing of entered characters (for
                        entering, say, a password).

                eeooff     If tteellnneett is operating in LINEMODE or ``old line by
                        line'' mode, entering this character as the first
                        character on a line will cause this character to be
                        sent to the remote system.  The initial value of the
                        eof character is taken to be the terminal's eeooff
                        character.

                eerraassee   If tteellnneett is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss
                        below), aanndd if tteellnneett is operating in ``character at a
                        time'' mode, then when this character is typed, a
                        TELNET EC sequence (see sseenndd eecc above) is sent to the
                        remote system.  The initial value for the erase
                        character is taken to be the terminal's eerraassee
                        character.

                eessccaappee  This is the tteellnneett escape character (initially ``^['')
                        which causes entry into tteellnneett command mode (when
                        connected to a remote system).

                fflluusshhoouuttppuutt
                        If tteellnneett is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss
                        below) and the fflluusshhoouuttppuutt character is typed, a
                        TELNET AO sequence (see sseenndd aaoo above) is sent to the
                        remote host.  The initial value for the flush
                        character is taken to be the terminal's fflluusshh
                        character.

                iinntteerrrruupptt
                        If tteellnneett is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss
                        below) and the iinntteerrrruupptt character is typed, a TELNET
                        IP sequence (see sseenndd iipp above) is sent to the remote
                        host.  The initial value for the interrupt character

                        is taken to be the terminal's iinnttrr character.

                kkiillll    If tteellnneett is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss
                        below), aanndd if tteellnneett is operating in ``character at a
                        time'' mode, then when this character is typed, a
                        TELNET EL sequence (see sseenndd eell above) is sent to the
                        remote system.  The initial value for the kill
                        character is taken to be the terminal's kkiillll
                        character.

                llnneexxtt   If tteellnneett is operating in LINEMODE or ``old line by
                        line`` mode, then this character is taken to be the
                        terminal's llnneexxtt character.  The initial value for the
                        lnext character is taken to be the terminal's llnneexxtt
                        character.

                qquuiitt    If tteellnneett is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss
                        below) and the qquuiitt character is typed, a TELNET BRK
                        sequence (see sseenndd bbrrkk above) is sent to the remote
                        host.  The initial value for the quit character is
                        taken to be the terminal's qquuiitt character.

                rreepprriinntt
                        If tteellnneett is operating in LINEMODE or ``old line by
                        line`` mode, then this character is taken to be the
                        terminal's rreepprriinntt character.  The initial value for
                        the reprint character is taken to be the terminal's
                        rreepprriinntt character.

                ssttaarrtt   If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been
                        enabled, then this character is taken to be the
                        terminal's ssttaarrtt character.  The initial value for the
                        kill character is taken to be the terminal's ssttaarrtt
                        character.

                ssttoopp    If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been
                        enabled, then this character is taken to be the
                        terminal's ssttoopp character.  The initial value for the
                        kill character is taken to be the terminal's ssttoopp
                        character.

                ssuusspp    If tteellnneett is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode, or LINEMODE is
                        enabled, and the ssuussppeenndd character is typed, a TELNET
                        SUSP sequence (see sseenndd ssuusspp above) is sent to the
                        remote host.  The initial value for the suspend
                        character is taken to be the terminal's ssuussppeenndd
                        character.

                ttrraacceeffiillee

                        is set to ``--'', then tracing information will be
                        written to standard output (the default).

                wwoorrddeerraassee
                        If tteellnneett is operating in LINEMODE or ``old line by
                        line`` mode, then this character is taken to be the
                        terminal's wwoorrddeerraassee character.  The initial value for
                        the worderase character is taken to be the terminal's
                        wwoorrddeerraassee character.

     ssllcc _s_t_a_t_e  The ssllcc command (Set Local Characters) is used to set or
                change the state of the the special characters when the TELNET
                LINEMODE option has been enabled.  Special characters are
                characters that get mapped to TELNET commands sequences (like
                iipp or qquuiitt) or line editing characters (like eerraassee and kkiillll).
                By default, the local special characters are exported.

                eexxppoorrtt      Switch to the local defaults for the special
                            characters.  The local default characters are
                            those of the local terminal at the time when
                            tteellnneett was started.

                            those of the remote system at the time when the
                            TELNET connection was established.

                            settings, and if there are any discrepencies with
                            the local side, the local side will switch to the

                The eennvviirroonn command is used to manipulate the the variables
                that my be sent through the TELNET ENVIRON option.  The
                initial set of variables is taken from the users environment,
                with only the DISPLAY and PRINTER variables being exported by
                default.  The USER variable is also exported if the --aa or --ll
                options are used.
                Valid arguments for the eennvviirroonn command are:

                            Define the variable _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e to have a value of
                            _v_a_l_u_e. Any variables defined by this command are
                            automatically exported.  The _v_a_l_u_e may be enclosed
                            in single or double quotes so that tabs and spaces
                            may be included.

                uunnddeeffiinnee _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
                            Remove _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e from the list of environment
                            variables.

                eexxppoorrtt _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
                            Mark the variable _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e to be exported to the
                            remote side.

                uunneexxppoorrtt _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
                            Mark the variable _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e to not be exported
                            unless explicitly asked for by the remote side.

                lliisstt        List the current set of environment variables.
                            Those marked with a ** will be sent automatically,
                            other variables will only be sent if explicitly
                            requested.

     ttooggggllee _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s ...
                Toggle (between TRUE and FALSE) various flags that control how
                tteellnneett responds to events.  These flags may be set explicitly
                to TRUE or FALSE using the sseett and uunnsseett commands listed
                above.  More than one argument may be specified.  The state of
                these flags may be interrogated with the ddiissppllaayy command.

                Valid arguments are:

                aauuttoofflluusshh     If aauuttoofflluusshh and llooccaallcchhaarrss are both TRUE, then
                              when the aaoo, or qquuiitt characters are recognized
                              (and transformed into TELNET sequences; see sseett
                              above for details), tteellnneett refuses to display
                              any data on the user's terminal until the remote
                              system acknowledges (via a TELNET TIMING MARK
                              option) that it has processed those TELNET
                              sequences.  The initial value for this toggle is
                              TRUE if the terminal user had not done an "stty
                              noflsh", otherwise FALSE (see stty(1)).

                aauuttoossyynncchh     If aauuttoossyynncchh and llooccaallcchhaarrss are both TRUE, then
                              when either the iinnttrr or qquuiitt characters is typed
                              (see sseett above for descriptions of the iinnttrr and
                              qquuiitt characters), the resulting TELNET sequence
                              sent is followed by the TELNET SYNCH sequence.
                              This procedure sshhoouulldd cause the remote system to
                              begin throwing away all previously typed input
                              until both of the TELNET sequences have been
                              read and acted upon.  The initial value of this
                              toggle is FALSE.

                bbiinnaarryy        Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on
                              both input and output.

                iinnbbiinnaarryy      Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on

                              output.

                ccrrllff          If this is TRUE, then carriage returns will be
                              sent as <CR><LF>. If this is FALSE, then
                              carriage returns will be send as <CR><NUL>. The
                              initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

                ccrrmmoodd         Toggle carriage return mode.  When this mode is
                              enabled, most carriage return characters
                              received from the remote host will be mapped
                              into a carriage return followed by a line feed.
                              This mode does not affect those characters typed
                              by the user, only those received from the remote
                              host.  This mode is not very useful unless the
                              remote host only sends carriage return, but
                              never line feed.  The initial value for this
                              toggle is FALSE.

                ddeebbuugg         Toggles socket level debugging (useful only to
                              the ssuuppeerr uusseerr). The initial value for this
                              toggle is FALSE.

                llooccaallcchhaarrss    If this is TRUE, then the fflluusshh, iinntteerrrruupptt,
                              qquuiitt, eerraassee, and kkiillll characters (see sseett above)
                              are recognized locally, and transformed into
                              (hopefully) appropriate TELNET control sequences
                              (respectively aaoo, iipp, bbrrkk, eecc, and eell; see sseenndd
                              above).  The initial value for this toggle is
                              TRUE in ``old line by line'' mode, and FALSE in
                              ``character at a time'' mode.  When the LINEMODE
                              option is enabled, the value of llooccaallcchhaarrss is
                              ignored, and assumed to always be TRUE. If
                              LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then qquuiitt is
                              sent as aabboorrtt, and eeooff aanndd are sent as eeooff aanndd

                              ssuusspp, see sseenndd above).

                nneettddaattaa       Toggles the display of all network data (in
                              hexadecimal format).  The initial value for this
                              toggle is FALSE.

                ooppttiioonnss       Toggles the display of some internal tteellnneett
                              protocol processing (having to do with TELNET
                              options).  The initial value for this toggle is
                              FALSE.

                pprreettttyydduummpp    When the nneettddaattaa toggle is enabled, if
                              pprreettttyydduummpp is enabled the output from the
                              nneettddaattaa command will be formated in a more user
                              readable format.  Spaces are put between each
                              character in the output, and the begining of any
                              TELNET escape sequence is preceeded by a '*' to
                              aid in locating them.
