       _C_o  retrieves  a revision from each RCS file and stores it
       into the corresponding working file.  Each file name  end-
       ing  in  `,v'  is taken to be an RCS file; all other files
       are assumed to be working files.  If only a  working  file
       is  given,  _c_o tries to find the corresponding RCS file in
       the directory ./RCS and then  in  the  current  directory.
       For more details, see the file naming section below.

       Revisions  of  an  RCS  file  may be checked out locked or
       unlocked. Locking a revision prevents overlapping updates.
       A  revision  checked  out for reading or processing (e.g.,
       compiling) need not be locked. A revision checked out  for
       editing and later checkin must normally be locked. _C_o with
       locking fails if the revision to be checked  out  is  cur-
       rently locked by another user.  (A lock may be broken with
       the _r_c_s(1L) command.)  _C_o with locking also  requires  the
       caller to be on the access list of the RCS file, unless he
       is the owner of the file or the superuser, or  the  access
       list  is  empty.   _C_o  without  locking  is not subject to
       accesslist restrictions, and is not affected by the  pres-
       ence of locks.

       A  revision  is selected by options for revision or branch
       number, checkin date/time, author,  or  state.   When  the
       selection options are applied in combination, _c_o retrieves
       the latest revision that satisfies all of them.   If  none
       of  the  selection  options is specified, _c_o retrieves the
       latest revision on the default branch (normally the trunk,
       see  the --bb option of _r_c_s(1L)).  A revision or branch num-
       ber may be attached to any of the options --ff, --ll, --pp,  --qq,
       --rr,  or  --uu.   The  options  --dd (date), --ss (state), and --ww
       (author) retrieve  from  a  single  branch,  the  _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d
       branch, which is either specified by one of --ff,..., --uu, or
       the default branch.

       A _c_o command applied to an RCS file with no revisions cre-
       ates  a zero-length working file.  _C_o always performs key-
       word substitution (see below).


       --rr[_r_e_v]    retrieves the latest revision whose  number  is
                  less  than or equal to _r_e_v.  If _r_e_v indicates a
                  branch rather than a revision, the latest revi-
                  sion  on  that  branch is retrieved.  If _r_e_v is
                  omitted, the latest  revision  on  the  default
                  branch  (see  the  --bb  option  of  _r_c_s(1L))  is
                  retrieved.  _R_e_v is  composed  of  one  or  more

                  numeric  or  symbolic  fields separated by `.'.
                  The numeric equivalent of a symbolic  field  is
                  specified  with  the  --nn option of the commands
                  _c_i(1L) and _r_c_s(1L).

       --ll[_r_e_v]    same as --rr,  except  that  it  also  locks  the
                  retrieved  revision for the caller.  See option
                  --rr for handling of the revision number _r_e_v .

       --uu[_r_e_v]    same  as  --rr,  except  that  it   unlocks   the
                  retrieved  revision  (if  it  was locked by the
                  caller). If _r_e_v is omitted,  --uu  retrieves  the
                  latest  revision  locked  by  the caller; if no
                  such lock exists, it retrieves the latest revi-
                  sion on the default branch.

       --ff[_r_e_v]    forces  the  overwriting  of  the working file;
                  useful in connection with  --qq.   See  also  the
                  section on file modes below.

       --pp[_r_e_v]    prints  the  retrieved revision on the standard
                  output rather than storing it  in  the  working
                  file.  This option is useful when _c_o is part of
                  a pipe.

       --qq[_r_e_v]    quiet mode; diagnostics are not printed.

       --dd_d_a_t_e     retrieves the latest revision on  the  selected
                  branch  whose checkin date/time is less than or
                  equal to _d_a_t_e.  The date and time may be  given
                  in free format and are converted to local time.
                  Examples of formats for _d_a_t_e:

                  _2_2-_A_p_r_i_l-_1_9_8_2, _1_7:_2_0-_C_D_T,
                  _2:_2_5 _A_M, _D_e_c. _2_9, _1_9_8_3,
                  _T_u_e-_P_D_T, _1_9_8_1, _4_p_m _J_u_l _2_1         (free format),

                  Most  fields  in  the  date  and  time  may  be
                  defaulted.   _C_o  determines the defaults in the
                  order year, month, day, hour, minute, and  sec-
                  ond  (most  to least significant). At least one
                  of these fields must be provided.  For  omitted
                  fields that are of higher significance than the
                  highest provided field, the current values  are
                  assumed. For all other omitted fields, the low-
                  est possible values are assumed.  For  example,
                  the  date  "20,  10:30" defaults to 10:30:00 of
                  the 20th of the current month and current year.
                  The  date/time  must  be  quoted if it contains
                  spaces.

       --ss_s_t_a_t_e    retrieves the latest revision on  the  selected
                  branch whose state is set to _s_t_a_t_e.

       --ww[_l_o_g_i_n]  retrieves  the  latest revision on the selected
                  branch which was checked in by  the  user  with
                  login  name  _l_o_g_i_n.  If  the  argument _l_o_g_i_n is
                  omitted, the caller's login is assumed.

       --jj_j_o_i_n_l_i_s_t generates a new revision which is the  join  of
                  the  revisions  on  _j_o_i_n_l_i_s_t.   _J_o_i_n_l_i_s_t  is  a
                  comma-separated  list  of  pairs  of  the  form
                  _r_e_v_2:_r_e_v_3, where _r_e_v_2 and _r_e_v_3 are (symbolic or
                  numeric) revision  numbers.   For  the  initial
                  such  pair,  _r_e_v_1 denotes the revision selected
                  by the above options --rr, ..., --ww. For all other
                  pairs,  _r_e_v_1  denotes the revision generated by
                  the previous pair. (Thus,  the  output  of  one
                  join becomes the input to the next.)

                  For each pair, _c_o joins revisions _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_3
                  with respect to  _r_e_v_2.   This  means  that  all
                  changes  that  transform  _r_e_v_2  into  _r_e_v_1  are
                  applied to a copy of _r_e_v_3.   This  is  particu-
                  larly  useful  if _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_3 are the ends of
                  two branches that have _r_e_v_2 as a common  ances-
                  tor.  If _r_e_v_1 < _r_e_v_2 < _r_e_v_3 on the same branch,
                  joining generates a new revision which is  like
                  _r_e_v_3,  but with all changes that lead from _r_e_v_1
                  to _r_e_v_2 undone.  If changes from _r_e_v_2  to  _r_e_v_1
                  overlap  with  changes  from  _r_e_v_2  to _r_e_v_3, _c_o
                  prints a warning and includes  the  overlapping
                  sections,  delimited by the lines <<<<<<< _r_e_v_1,
                  =======, and >>>>>>> _r_e_v_3.

                  For the initial pair, _r_e_v_2 may be omitted.  The
                  default  is the common ancestor.  If any of the
                  arguments indicate branches, the  latest  revi-
                  sions  on  those  branches  are  assumed.   The
                  options --ll and --uu lock or unlock _r_e_v_1.

       Strings of the form $_k_e_y_w_o_r_d$ and  $_k_e_y_w_o_r_d:...$  embedded

       listed below.  Keywords may be embedded in literal strings
       or comments to identify a revision.

       Initially, the user enters strings of the form  $_k_e_y_w_o_r_d$.
       On checkout, _c_o replaces these strings with strings of the
       form $_k_e_y_w_o_r_d: _v_a_l_u_e $. If a revision  containing  strings
       of  the  latter  form is checked back in, the value fields
       will be replaced during the next checkout.  Thus, the key-
       word values are automatically updated on checkout.

       Keywords and their corresponding values:

                    revision.

       $Date$       The date and time the  revision  was  checked
                    in.

       $Header$     A  standard  header containing the full path-
                    name of the RCS file,  the  revision  number,
                    the  date,  the  author,  the  state, and the
                    locker (if locked).

       $Id$         Same as $Header$, except that  the  RCS  file
                    name is without a path.

       $Locker$     The  login  name  of  the user who locked the
                    revision (empty if not locked).

       $Log$        The log message supplied during checkin, pre-
                    ceded  by  a  header  containing the RCS file
                    name, the revision number,  the  author,  and
                    the  date.   Existing  log  messages  are NOT
                    replaced.  Instead, the new  log  message  is
                    inserted after $_L_o_g:...$.  This is useful for
                    accumulating  a  complete  change  log  in  a
                    source file.

       $RCSfile$    The name of the RCS file without path.

       $Revision$   The revision number assigned to the revision.

       $Source$     The full pathname of the RCS file.

       $State$      The state assigned to the revision  with  the
                    --ss option of _r_c_s(1L) or _c_i(1L).

              Pairs  of RCS files and working files may be speci-
              fied in 3 ways (see also the example section).

       1) Both the RCS file and the working file are  given.  The
       RCS  file  name  is  of  the form _p_a_t_h_1/_w_o_r_k_f_i_l_e,_v and the
       working file name is of  the  form  _p_a_t_h_2/_w_o_r_k_f_i_l_e,  where
       _p_a_t_h_1/  and _p_a_t_h_2/ are (possibly different or empty) paths
       and _w_o_r_k_f_i_l_e is a file name.

       2) Only the RCS file is given. Then the  working  file  is
       created  in  the current directory and its name is derived
       from the name of the RCS file by removing _p_a_t_h_1/  and  the
       suffix ,_v.

       3)  Only  the working file is given.  Then _c_o looks for an
       RCS   file   of   the   form    _p_a_t_h_2/_R_C_S/_w_o_r_k_f_i_l_e,_v    or
       _p_a_t_h_2/_w_o_r_k_f_i_l_e,_v (in this order).

       If  the RCS file is specified without a path in 1) and 2),
       then _c_o looks for the RCS  file  first  in  the  directory
       ./RCS and then in the current directory.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       Suppose  the  current  directory  contains  a subdirectory
       `RCS' with an RCS file `io.c,v'. Then all of the following
       commands  retrieve  the  latest revision from `RCS/io.c,v'
       and store it into `io.c'.

            co  io.c;    co  RCS/io.c,v;   co  io.c,v;
            co  io.c  RCS/io.c,v;    co  io.c  io.c,v;
            co  RCS/io.c,v  io.c;    co  io.c,v  io.c;

FFIILLEE MMOODDEESS
       The working file inherits the read and execute permissions
       from the RCS file. In addition, the owner write permission
       is turned on, unless the file is checked out unlocked  and
       locking is set to _s_t_r_i_c_t (see _r_c_s(1L)).

       If a file with the name of the working file exists already
       and has write permission, _c_o aborts the checkout if --qq  is
       given, or asks whether to abort if --qq is not given. If the
       existing working file is not writable or --ff is given,  the
       working file is deleted without asking.

FFIILLEESS
       The  caller  of  the command must have write permission in
       the working directory, read permission for the  RCS  file,
       and  either  read  permission  (for reading) or read/write
       permission (for locking) in the directory  which  contains
       the RCS file.

       A number of temporary files are created.  A semaphore file
       is created in the directory of the  RCS  file  to  prevent
       simultaneous update.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       The RCS file name, the working file name, and the revision
       number retrieved are written  to  the  diagnostic  output.
       The  exit  status  always  refers to the last file checked
       out, and is 0 if the operation was  successful,  1  other-
       wise.

       The option --dd gets confused  in  some  circumstances,  and
       accepts no date before 1970.  Links to the RCS and working
       files are not preserved.  There is no way to suppress  the
       expansion of keywords, except by writing them differently.
       In nroff and troff, this is done by  embedding  the  null-
       character `\&' into the keyword.

       The  option  --jj does not work for files that contain lines
       with a single `.'.
