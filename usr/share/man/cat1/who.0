     The utility wwhhoo displays a list of all users currently logged on, showing
     for each user the login name, tty name, the date and time of login, and
     hostname if not local.

     Available options:

     _a_m _I  Returns the invoker's real user name.

     _f_i_l_e  By default, wwhhoo gathers information from the file /_v_a_r/_r_u_n/_u_t_m_p. An
           alternate _f_i_l_e may be specified which is usually /_v_a_r/_r_u_n/_w_t_m_p (or
           /_v_a_r/_r_u_n/_w_t_m_p.[_0-_6] depending on site policy as _w_t_m_p can grow quite
           large and daily versions may or may not kept around after
           compression by ac(8)).  The _w_t_m_p file contains a record of every
           login, logout, crash, shutdown and date change since _w_t_m_p was last
           truncated or created.

     If /_v_a_r/_l_o_g/_w_t_m_p is being used as the file, the user name may be empty or
     one of the special characters '|', '}' and '~'.  Logouts produce an
     output line without any user name.  For more information on the special
     characters, see utmp(5).
