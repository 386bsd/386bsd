     ccoommmm - Select or reject lines common to two files

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     ccoommmm [--112233] _f_i_l_e_1 _f_i_l_e_2

     The ccoommmm utility reads _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2, which should be sorted lexically,
     and produces three text columns as output: lines only in _f_i_l_e_1; lines
     only in _f_i_l_e_2; and lines in both files.

     The filename ``-'' means the standard input.

     The following options are available:

     --11      Suppress printing of column 1.

     --22      Suppress printing of column 2.

     --33      Suppress printing of column 3.

     Each column will have a number of tab characters prepended to it equal to
     the number of lower numbered columns that are being printed.  For
     example, if column number two is being suppressed, lines printed in
     column number one will not have any tabs preceding them, and lines
     printed in column number three will have one.

     CCoommmm assumes that the files are lexically sorted; all characters
     participate in line comparisons.

     CCoommmm exits 0 on success, >0 if an error occurred.

     The ccoommmm command is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.
