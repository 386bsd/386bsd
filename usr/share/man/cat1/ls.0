     For each operand that names a _f_i_l_e of a type other than directory, llss
     displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For
     each operand that names a _f_i_l_e of type directory, llss displays the names
     of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested,
     associated information.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are
     displayed.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are
     displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted
     separately and in lexicographical order.

     The following options are available:

     --AA      List all entries except for `.' and `..'. Always set for the
             super-user.

     --CC      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to
             a terminal.

     --FF      Display a slash (/) immediately after each pathname that is a
             directory, an asterisk (*) after each that is executable, and an
             at sign (@) after each symbolic link.

     --LL      If argument is a symbolic link, list the file or directory the
             link references rather than the link itself.

     --RR      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

     --TT      Display complete time information for the file, including month,
             day, hour, minute, second, and year.

     --aa      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).

     --cc      Use time when file status was last changed for sorting or
             printing.

     --dd      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).

     --ff      Output is not sorted.

     --gg      Include the group ownership of the file in a long (--ll) output
             (--llgg). If the group is not a known group name, the numeric ID is
             printed.

     --ii      For each file, print the file's file serial number (inode
             number).

     --kk      Modifies the --ss option, causing the sizes to be reported in
             kilobytes.

     --ll      (The lowercase letter ``ell.'')  List in long format. (See
             below.)  If the output is to a terminal, a total sum for all the
             file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.

     --qq      Force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as the
             character `?'; this is the default when output is to a terminal.


     --rr      Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical
             order or the oldest entries first.

     --ss      Display the number of file system bytes actually used by each
             file, in units of 512, where partial units are rounded up to the
             next integer value.  If the output is to a terminal, a total sum
             for all the file sizes is output on a line before the listing.

     --tt      Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before
             sorting the operands by lexicographical order.

     --uu      Use time of last access, instead of last modification of the file
             for sorting (--tt) or printing (--ll).

     --11      (The numeric digit ``one.'')  Force output to be one entry per
             line.  This is the default when output is not to a terminal.

     The --11, --CC, and --ll options all override each other; the last one
     specified determines the format used.

     The --cc, and --uu options override each other; the last one specified
     determines the file time used.

     By default, llss lists one entry per line to standard output; the
     exceptions are to terminals or when the --CC option is specified.

     File information is displayed with one or more <blank>s separating the
     information associated with the --ii, --ss, and --ll options.

   TThhee LLoonngg FFoorrmmaatt
     If the --ll option is given, the following information is be displayed:
     file mode, number of links, owner name, number of bytes in the file,
     abbreviated month, day-of-month file was last modified, hour file last
     modified, minute file last modified, and the pathname.

     If the owner name is not a known user name the numeric ID is displayed.

     If the file is a character special or block special file, the major and
     minor device numbers for the file are displayed in the size field. If the
     file is a symbolic link the pathname of the linked-to file is preceded by
     ``->''.

     The file mode printed under the -l option consists of the the entry type,
     owner permissions, and group permissions.  The entry type character
     describes the type of file, as follows:

           bb     Block special file.
           cc     Character special file.
           dd     Directory.
           ll     Symbolic link.
           ss     Socket link.
           --     Regular file.

     The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group
     permissions, and other permissions.  Each field has three character
     positions:

           1.   If rr, the file is readable; if --, it is not readable.

           2.   If ww, the file is writable; if --, it is not writable.

           3.   The first of the following that applies:

                      SS     If in the owner permissions, the file is not
                            executable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the
                            group permissions, the file is not executable and
                            set-group-ID mode is set.

                      ss     If in the owner permissions, the file is
                            executable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the
                            group permissions, the file is executable and
                            setgroup-ID mode is set.

                      xx     The file is executable or the directory is
                            searchable.

                      --     The file is neither readable, writeable,
                            exectutable, or set-user-ID or set-group-ID mode
                            nor sticky. (See below.)

                These next two apply only to the third character in the last
                group (other permissions).

                      TT     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), but not execute
                            or search permission. (See chmod(1) or sticky(8).)


                      tt     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), and is
                            searcheable or executable.  (See chmod(1) or
                            sticky(8).)

     The llss utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The following environment variables affect the execution of llss:

     COLUMNS  If this variable contains a string representing a decimal
              integer, it is used as the column position width for displaying
              multiple-text-column output.  The llss utility calculates how many
              pathname text columns to display based on the width provided.
