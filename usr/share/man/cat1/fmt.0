     FFmmtt is a simple text formatter which reads the concatenation of input
     files (or standard input if none are given) and produces on standard
     output a version of its input with lines as close to the _g_o_a_l length as
     possible without exceeding the maximum.  The _g_o_a_l length defaults to 65
     and the maximum to 75.  The spacing at the beginning of the input lines
     is preserved in the output, as are blank lines and interword spacing.

     FFmmtt is meant to format mail messages prior to sending, but may also be
     useful for other simple tasks.  For instance, within visual mode of the
     ex(1) editor (e.g.  vi(1))  the command

           !}fmt

     will reformat a paragraph, evening the lines.

     The ffmmtt command appeared in 3BSD.

     The program was designed to be simple and fast - for more complex
     operations, the standard text processors are likely to be more
     appropriate.
