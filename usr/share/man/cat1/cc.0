       _C_c  is  a  version  of  the  GNU C compiler.  It accepts a
       dialect of ANSI C with extensions; this dialect is differ-
       ent from the dialect used in 4.3 BSD and earlier distribu-
       tions.  The  --ttrraaddiittiioonnaall  flag  causes  the  compiler  to
       accept a dialect of extended Classic C, much like the C of
       these earlier  distributions.   If  you  are  not  already
       familiar  with  ANSI C and its new features, you will want
       to build your software with --ttrraaddiittiioonnaall.

DDIIFFFFEERREENNCCEESS
       Most older C compiler flags are supported  by  _c_c.   Three
       that  are  not are: --ggoo, to generate symbol tables for the
       unsupported _s_d_b debugger; --ff, for single precision  float-
       ing  point  in  expressions, which is now the default; and
       --tt, for alternate compiler passes.

       The differences between ANSI C and Classic C dialects  are
       too  numerous  to  describe here in detail.  The following
       quick summary is meant to make users  aware  of  potential
       subtle  problems when converting Classic C code to ANSI C.

       The most obvious change is the pervasive use  of  _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n
       _p_r_o_t_o_t_y_p_e_s.  Under the ANSI C dialect, the number and type
       of arguments to C library functions  are  checked  by  the
       compiler  when  standard  header files are included; calls
       that fail to match will yield  errors.   A  subtle  conse-
       quence  of adding prototype declarations is that user code
       that inadvertently redefines  a  C  library  function  may
       break;  for  example  it is no longer possible to write an
       _a_b_o_r_t function that takes different parameters or  returns
       a  different value from the standard _a_b_o_r_t, when including
       standard header files.  Another issue with  prototypes  is
       that  functions  that  take  different  parameter types no
       longer have the same type; function pointers now differ by
       parameter  types  as well as return types.  Variable argu-
       ment lists are handled  differently;  the  old  _v_a_r_a_r_g_s(3)
       package is obsolete, replaced by _s_t_d_a_r_g(3), which unfortu-
       nately is not completely compatible.  A subtle  change  in
       type  promotion can be confusing: small unsigned types are
       now widened into signed types rather than unsigned  types.
       A  similar  problem  can  occur  with the ssiizzeeooff operator,
       which now yields an unsigned type  rather  than  a  signed
       type.   One  common problem is due to a change in scoping:
       external declarations are now scoped  to  the  block  they
       occur  in,  so  a  declaration  for (say) eerrrrnnoo inside one
       block will no longer declare it in all subsequent  blocks.
       The  syntax for braces in structure initializations is now

       a bit stricter, and  it  is  sometimes  necessary  to  add
       braces  to please the compiler.  Two very subtle and some-
       times very annoying features apply to constant strings and
       to  the _l_o_n_g_j_m_p(3) function.  Constant strings in the ANSI
       dialect are read-only; attempts to alter them  cause  pro-
       tection  violations.   This  ANSI feature permits the com-
       piler to coalesce identical strings  in  the  same  source
       file, and saves space when multiple copies of a binary are
       running at the same time, since the read-only  part  of  a
       binary is sharable.  The most common difficulty with read-
       only strings lies with the use  of  the  mmkktteemmpp  function,
       which  in  the  past often altered a constant string argu-
       ment.  It is now necessary to copy a constant string  (for
       example,  with  _s_t_r_d_u_p(3))  before it may be altered.  The
       lloonnggjjmmpp function may now destroy  any  register  _o_r  stack
       variable  in the function that made the corresponding call
       to the sseettjjmmpp function; to protect a local  variable,  the
       new ANSI vvoollaattiillee modifier must be used.  This often leads
       to confusing situations upon `return'  from  sseettjjmmpp.   The
       compiler has extended warning flags for dealing with read-
       only strings and sseettjjmmpp, but these are not very effective.
       If your code has problems with any of these ANSI features,
       you will probably want to use --ttrraaddiittiioonnaall.

       Even with --ttrraaddiittiioonnaall, there are some differences between
       this  dialect  of  Classic  C and the dialect supported on
       older distributions.

       There are at least two differences that are a  consequence
       of  the fact that _c_c uses an ANSI C style grammar for both
       traditional and ANSI modes.  The old C dialect permitted a
       typedef  to  replace a simple type in the idiom ``unsigned
       _t_y_p_e''; this _c_c treats such forms as syntax  errors.   The
       old C dialect also permitted formal parameters to have the
       same names as typedef types; the current dialect does not.

       Some questionable or illegal practices that were supported
       in the old C dialect are not  supported  by  --ttrraaddiittiioonnaall:
       non-comment text at the end of a ``#include'' preprocessor
       control line is an error, not ignored; compound assignment
       operators  must  not contain white space, _e._g.  ``* ='' is
       not the same as ``*=''; the last member declaration  in  a
       structure  or  union must be terminated by a semicolon; it
       is not possible to ``switch'' on function  pointers;  more
       than  one  occurrence  of ``#else'' at the same level in a
       preprocessor ``#if'' clause is an error, not ignored.

       Some truly ancient C practices are  no  longer  supported.
       The  idiom  of  declaring an anonymous structure and using
       its members to extract fields  from  other  structures  or
       even non-structures is illegal.  Integers are not automat-
       ically converted to pointers when they  are  dereferenced.
       The  --ttrraaddiittiioonnaall  dialect  does  not retain the so-called
       ``old-fashioned'' assignment  operators  (with  the  ``=''

       preceding  rather than following the operator) or initial-
       izations (with no ``='' between initializer  and  initial-
       izee).

WWAARRNNIINNGG
       This  rest  of man page is an extract of the documentation
       of the _G_N_U _C _c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r and is limited to the meaning of the
       options.   IItt  iiss  nnoott kkeepptt uupp ttoo ddaattee.  If you want to be
       certain of the information below, check it in  the  manual
       "Using  and Porting GCC".  Refer to the Info file ggcccc..iinnffoo
       or the DVI file ggcccc..ddvvii which are made  from  the  Texinfo
       source file ggcccc..tteexxiinnffoo.

       The  _G_N_U  _C  _c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r  uses a command syntax much like the
       Unix C compiler.  The _c_c program accepts options and  file
       names as operands.  Multiple single-letter options may _n_o_t
       be grouped: --ddrr is very different from --dd --rr.

       When you invoke GNU CC, it  normally  does  preprocessing,
       compilation,  assembly  and linking.  File names which end
       in ..cc are taken as C source to be  preprocessed  and  com-
       piled;  file  names ending in ..ii are taken as preprocessor
       output to be compiled;  compiler  output  files  plus  any
       input  files  with  names ending in ..ss are assembled; then
       the resulting object files, plus any  other  input  files,
       are linked together to produce an executable.

       Command  options  allow  you  to  stop  this process at an
       intermediate stage.  For example, the --cc option  says  not
       to  run  the  linker.   Then the output consists of object
       files output by the assembler.

       Other command options are passed on to one stage  of  pro-
       cessing.  Some options control the preprocessor and others
       the compiler itself.  Yet other options control the assem-
       bler  and  linker;  these are not documented here, but you
       rarely need to use any of them.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Here are the options to control  the  overall  compilation
       process, including those that say whether to link, whether
       to assemble, and so on.

       --oo _f_i_l_e
              Place output in file _f_i_l_e.  This applies regardless
              to  whatever  sort  of  output  is  being produced,
              whether it be an executable file, an  object  file,
              an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

              If  --oo  is  not specified, the default is to put an
              executable file in aa..oouutt, the object file  _s_o_u_r_c_e..cc
              in  _s_o_u_r_c_e..oo,  an  assembler  file in _s_o_u_r_c_e..ss, and
              preprocessed C on standard output.

       --cc     Compile or assemble the source files,  but  do  not
              link.   Produce  object  files  with  names made by
              replacing ..cc or ..ss with ..oo at the end of the  input
              file  names.   Do  nothing  at all for object files
              specified as input.

       --SS     Compile into assembler code but  do  not  assemble.
              The assembler output file name is made by replacing
              ..cc with ..ss at the end of the input file  name.   Do
              nothing at all for assembler source files or object
              files specified as input.

       --EE     Run only the C preprocessor.  Preprocess all the  C
              source  files  specified  and output the results to
              standard output.

       --vv     Compiler driver program prints the commands it exe-
              cutes as it runs the preprocessor, compiler proper,
              assembler and linker.  Some of these  are  directed
              to print their own version numbers.

       --ppiippee  Use  pipes rather than temporary files for communi-
              cation between the various stages  of  compilation.
              This fails to work on some systems where the assem-
              bler is unable to read from a  pipe;  but  the  GNU
              assembler has no trouble.

       --BB_p_r_e_f_i_x
              Compiler  driver  program  tries _p_r_e_f_i_x as a prefix
              for each program it tries to run.   These  programs
              are _c_p_p, _c_c_1, _a_s and _l_d.

              For  each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver
              first tries the --BB prefix, if any.  If that name is
              not  found,  or if --BB was not specified, the driver
              tries  a  standard  prefix,  which   currently   is
              //uussrr//lliibbeexxeecc//.   If  this does not result in a file
              name that is found, the unmodified program name  is
              searched  for  using  the  directories specified in
              your PPAATTHH environment variable.

              You can get a similar result from  the  environment
              variable  GGCCCC__EEXXEECC__PPRREEFFIIXX;  if  it  is defined, its
              value is used as a prefix in the same way.  If both
              the  --BB option and the GGCCCC__EEXXEECC__PPRREEFFIIXX variable are
              present, the --BB option is used first and the  envi-
              ronment variable value second.

       --bb_p_r_e_f_i_x
              The  argument _p_r_e_f_i_x is used as a second prefix for
              the compiler executables and libraries.  This  pre-
              fix is optional: the compiler tries each file first
              with it, then without it.  This prefix follows  the
              prefix specified with --BB or the default prefixes.

              Thus,  --bbvvaaxx--  --BBcccc// in the presence of environment
              variable GGCCCC__EEXXEECC__PPRREEFFIIXX  with  definition  //uu//ffoooo//
              causes  GNU  CC to try the following file names for
              the preprocessor executable:

                   cccc//vvaaxx--ccpppp
                   cccc//ccpppp

                   //uu//ffoooo//ccpppp

                   //uussrr//lliibbeexxeecc//ccpppp

       These options control the details of C compilation itself.

       --aannssii  Support all ANSI standard C programs.

              This  turns  off certain features of GNU C that are
              incompatible with ANSI C, such as the  aassmm,  iinnlliinnee
              and  ttyyppeeooff keywords, and predefined macros such as
              uunniixx and vvaaxx that identify the type of  system  you
              are  using.   It  also  enables the undesirable and
              rarely used ANSI trigraph feature.

              The  alternate  keywords  ____aassmm____,  ____iinnlliinnee____  and
              ____ttyyppeeooff____  continue  to  work  despite --aannssii.  You
              would not want to use them in an ANSI C program, of
              course,  but  it useful to put them in header files
              that might be included in  compilations  done  with
              --aannssii.    Alternate   predefined   macros  such  as
              ____uunniixx____ and ____vvaaxx____ are also  available,  with  or
              without --aannssii.

              The  --aannssii  option does not cause non-ANSI programs
              to be rejected gratuitously.  For  that,  --ppeeddaannttiicc
              is required in addition to --aannssii.

              The  macro  ____SSTTRRIICCTT__AANNSSII____  is predefined when the
              --aannssii option is used.  Some header files may notice
              this macro and refrain from declaring certain func-
              tions or defining  certain  macros  that  the  ANSI
              standard  doesn't call for; this is to avoid inter-
              fering with any programs that might use these names
              for other things.

              their values are stringified, though without  addi-
              tional quote marks, when they appear in such a con-
              text).  The preprocessor always considers a  string
              constant to end at a newline.

            *  The  predefined macro ____SSTTDDCC____ is not defined when
              you use --ttrraaddiittiioonnaall, but ____GGNNUUCC____  is  (since  the
              GNU  extensions  which  ____GGNNUUCC____  indicates are not
              affected by --ttrraaddiittiioonnaall).  If you  need  to  write
              header  files  that  work  differently depending on
              whether --ttrraaddiittiioonnaall is in use, by testing both  of
              these  predefined  macros  you can distinguish four
              situations: GNU C, traditional GNU C, other ANSI  C
              compilers, and other old C compilers.

       --OO     Optimize.   Optimizing  compilation  takes somewhat
              more time, and a lot more memory for a large  func-
              tion.

              Without  --OO,  the  compiler's goal is to reduce the
              cost of compilation and to make  debugging  produce
              the  expected results.  Statements are independent:
              if you stop the program with a  breakpoint  between
              statements,  you can then assign a new value to any
              variable or change the program counter to any other
              statement  in  the  function  and  get  exactly the
              results you would expect from the source code.

              Without --OO, only variables  declared  rreeggiisstteerr  are
              allocated  in  registers.   The  resulting compiled
              code is a little worse than produced by PCC without
              --OO.

              With --OO, the compiler tries to reduce code size and
              execution time.

              Some of the --ff options described  below  turn  spe-
              cific kinds of optimization on or off.

       --gg     Produce debugging information in the operating sys-
              tem's native format (for DBX or SDB).  GDB also can
              work with this debugging information.

              Unlike most other C compilers, GNU CC allows you to
              use --gg with --OO.  The shortcuts taken  by  optimized
              code  may  occasionally produce surprising results:
              some variables you declared may not exist  at  all;
              flow  of control may briefly move where you did not
              expect it; some  statements  may  not  be  executed
              because they compute constant results or their val-
              ues were already at hand; some statements may  exe-
              cute  in  different  places because they were moved
              out of loops.  Nevertheless it proves  possible  to
              debug  optimized  output.  This makes it reasonable
              to use the optimizer for programs that  might  have
              bugs.

       --ww     Inhibit all warning messages.

       --WW     Print extra warning messages for these events:

            *  An  automatic variable is used without first being
              initialized.

              These warnings are possible only in optimizing com-
              pilation,  because  they require data flow informa-
              tion that is computed only when optimizing.  If you
              don't  specify --OO, you simply won't get these warn-
              ings.

              These warnings occur only for  variables  that  are
              candidates  for  register  allocation.   Therefore,
              they do not occur for a variable that  is  declared
              vvoollaattiillee,  or whose address is taken, or whose size
              is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.   Also,  they  do
              not  occur  for  structures, unions or arrays, even
              when they are in registers.

              Note that there may be no warning about a  variable
              that is used only to compute a value that itself is
              never  used,  because  such  computations  may   be
              deleted  by  data flow analysis before the warnings
              are printed.

              These warnings are made optional because GNU CC  is
              not  smart  enough  to  see all the reasons why the
              code might be correct despite appearing to have  an

              error.  Here is one example of how this can happen:

                   {
                     int x;
                     switch (y)
                       {
                       case 1: x = 1;
                         break;
                       case 2: x = 4;
                         break;
                       case 3: x = 5;
                       }
                     foo (x);
                   }

              If the value of _y is always 1, 2 or 3,  then  _x  is
              always  initialized,  but GNU CC doesn't know this.
              Here is another common case:

                   {
                     int save_y;
                     if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
                     ...
                     if (change_y) y = save_y;
                   }

              This has no bug because _s_a_v_e__y is used only  if  it
              is set.

              Some  spurious  warnings  can  be  avoided  if  you
              declare as vvoollaattiillee all the functions you use  that
              never return.

            *  A  nonvolatile automatic variable might be changed
              by a call to _l_o_n_g_j_m_p(3C).  These warnings  as  well
              are possible only in optimizing compilation.

              The compiler sees only the calls to _s_e_t_j_m_p(3C).  It
              cannot know where _l_o_n_g_j_m_p(3C) will  be  called;  in
              fact,  a  signal handler could call it at any point
              in the code.  As a result, you may  get  a  warning
              even  when  there  is  in  fact  no problem because
              _l_o_n_g_j_m_p(3C) cannot in fact be called at  the  place
              which would cause a problem.

            *  A  function  can  return  either with or without a
              value.  (Falling off the end of the  function  body
              is  considered  returning  without  a  value.)  For
              example, this function would evoke such a warning:

                   foo (a)
                   {
                     if (a > 0)
                       return a;

                   }

              Spurious warnings can occur because GNU CC does not
              realize that certain functions (including _a_b_o_r_t(3C)
              and _l_o_n_g_j_m_p(3C)) will never return.

            * An expression-statement contains no side effects.

              In the future, other useful warnings  may  also  be
              enabled by this option.

       --WWiimmpplliicciitt
              Warn whenever a function is implicitly declared.

       --WWrreettuurrnn--ttyyppee
              Warn  whenever a function is defined with a return-
              type that defaults to iinntt.   Also  warn  about  any
              rreettuurrnn statement with no return-value in a function
              whose return-type is not vvooiidd.

       --WWuunnuusseedd
              Warn whenever a local variable is unused aside from
              its   declaration,   and  whenever  a  function  is
              declared static but never defined.

       --WWsswwiittcchh
              Warn whenever a sswwiittcchh statement has  an  index  of
              enumeral  type  and lacks a ccaassee for one or more of
              the named codes of that enumeration.  (The presence
              of  a  ddeeffaauulltt  label prevents this warning.)  ccaassee
              labels outside the enumeration range  also  provoke
              warnings when this option is used.

       --WWccoommmmeenntt
              Warn  whenever  a comment-start sequence //** appears
              in a comment.

       --WWttrriiggrraapphhss
              Warn if any  trigraphs  are  encountered  (assuming
              they are enabled).

       --WWaallll  All  of  the  above --WW options combined.  These are
              all the options which pertain to usage that  we  do
              not recommend and that we believe is always easy to
              avoid, even in conjunction with macros.

              The other --WW...  options below are not  implied  by
              --WWaallll  because  certain  kinds of useful macros are
              almost impossible to write  without  causing  those
              warnings.

       --WWsshhaaddooww
              Warn  whenever  a  local  variable  shadows another
              local variable.

       --WWiidd--ccllaasshh--_l_e_n
              Warn whenever two distinct identifiers match in the
              first  _l_e_n characters.  This may help you prepare a
              program that will compile  with  certain  obsolete,
              brain-damaged compilers.

       --WWppooiinntteerr--aarriitthh
              Warn  about  anything that depends on the size of a
              function type or of  vvooiidd.   GNU  C  assigns  these
              types  a size of 1, for convenience in calculations
              with vvooiidd ** pointers and pointers to functions.

       --WWccaasstt--qquuaall
              Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to  remove  a
              type  qualifier from the target type.  For example,
              warn if a ccoonnsstt cchhaarr ** is cast to an ordinary  cchhaarr
              **.

       --WWwwrriittee--ssttrriinnggss
              Give  string  constants the type ccoonnsstt cchhaarr[[_l_e_n_g_t_h]]
              so that copying the address of one into a non-ccoonnsstt
              cchhaarr  ** pointer will get a warning.  These warnings
              will help you find at compile time  code  that  can
              try  to  write  into a string constant, but only if
              you have been very careful  about  using  ccoonnsstt  in
              declarations  and  prototypes.   Otherwise, it will
              just be a nuisance; this is why  we  did  not  make
              --WWaallll request these warnings.

       --pp     Generate  extra  code  to write profile information
              suitable for the analysis program _p_r_o_f(1).

       --ppgg    Generate extra code to  write  profile  information
              suitable for the analysis program _g_p_r_o_f(1).

       --aa     Generate  extra  code  to write profile information
              for basic blocks, suitable for the analysis program
              _t_c_o_v(1).    Eventually   GNU   _g_p_r_o_f(1)  should  be
              extended to process this data.

       --ll_l_i_b_r_a_r_y
              Search a standard list of directories for a library
              named  _l_i_b_r_a_r_y, which is actually a file named lliibb--
              _l_i_b_r_a_r_y..aa.  The linker uses this file as if it  had
              been specified precisely by name.

              The  directories  searched include several standard
              system directories plus any that you  specify  with
              --LL.

              Normally  the  files  found  this  way  are library
              files--archive  files  whose  members  are   object
              files.  The linker handles an archive file by scan-
              ning through it for members  which  define  symbols

              that  have  so far been referenced but not defined.
              But if the file that is found is an ordinary object
              file,  it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
              difference between using an --ll option and  specify-
              ing  a file name is that --ll searches several direc-
              tories.

       --LL_d_i_r  Add directory _d_i_r to the list of directories to  be
              searched for --ll.

       --nnoossttddlliibb
              Don't use the standard system libraries and startup
              files when linking.  Only  the  files  you  specify
              (plus ggnnuulliibb) will be passed to the linker.

       --mm_m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s_p_e_c
              Machine-dependent option specifying something about
              the type of  target  machine.   These  options  are
              defined by the macro TTAARRGGEETT__SSWWIITTCCHHEESS in the machine
              description.  The default for the options  is  also
              defined  by that macro, which enables you to change
              the defaults.

              These are the  --mm  options  defined  in  the  68000
              machine description:

              --mm6688002200
              --mmcc6688002200
                   Generate  output  for  a  68020 (rather than a
                   68000).  This is the default if  you  use  the
                   unmodified sources.

              --mm6688000000
              --mmcc6688000000
                   Generate  output  for  a  68000 (rather than a
                   68020).

              --mm6688888811
                   Generate output containing 68881  instructions
                   for  floating  point.   This is the default if
                   you use the unmodified sources.

              --mmffppaa
                   Generate output containing  Sun  FPA  instruc-
                   tions for floating point.

              --mmssoofftt--ffllooaatt
                   Generate  output  containing library calls for
                   floating point.

              --mmsshhoorrtt
                   Consider type iinntt to be  16  bits  wide,  like

              --mmnnoobbiittffiieelldd
                   Do   not   use   the  bit-field  instructions.
                   --mm6688000000 implies --mmnnoobbiittffiieelldd.

              --mmbbiittffiieelldd
                   Do use the  bit-field  instructions.   --mm6688002200
                   implies  --mmbbiittffiieelldd.   This  is the default if
                   you use the unmodified sources.

              --mmrrttdd
                   Use a different  function-calling  convention,
                   in which functions that take a fixed number of
                   arguments return  with  the  rrttdd  instruction,
                   which  pops  their  arguments while returning.
                   This saves one instruction in the caller since
                   there is no need to pop the arguments there.

                   This  calling  convention is incompatible with
                   the one normally used on Unix, so  you  cannot
                   use  it if you need to call libraries compiled
                   with the Unix compiler.

                   Also, you must provide function prototypes for
                   all  functions  that  take variable numbers of
                   arguments  (including  pprriinnttff(3S));  otherwise
                   incorrect  code will be generated for calls to
                   those functions.

                   In addition,  seriously  incorrect  code  will
                   result  if  you  call a function with too many
                   arguments.   (Normally,  extra  arguments  are
                   harmlessly ignored.)

                   The  rrttdd instruction is supported by the 68010
                   and 68020 processors, but not by the 68000.

              These --mm options are defined  in  the  Vax  machine
              description:

              --mmuunniixx
                   Do   not   output  certain  jump  instructions
                   (aaoobblleeqq and so on) that the Unix assembler for
                   the Vax cannot handle across long ranges.

              --mmggnnuu
                   Do  output  those  jump  instructions,  on the
                   assumption that you will assemble with the GNU
                   assembler.

              --mmgg
                   Output  code  for g-format floating point num-
                   bers instead of d-format.

              --mmffppuu
                   Generate  output  containing  floating   point
                   instructions.   This is the default if you use
                   the unmodified sources.

              --mmssoofftt--ffllooaatt
                   Generate output containing library  calls  for
                   floating point.

              --mmnnoo--eeppiilloogguuee
                   Generate   separate  return  instructions  for
                   rreettuurrnn statements.  This has  both  advantages
                   and  disadvantages;  I  don't recall what they
                   are.

              These --mm options are defined in the Convex  machine
              description:

              --mmcc11
                   Generate output for a C1.  This is the default
                   when the compiler is configured for a C1.

              --mmcc22
                   Generate output for a C2.  This is the default
                   when the compiler is configured for a C2.

              --mmaarrggccoouunntt
                   Generate  code which puts an argument count in
                   the word preceding each argument  list.   Some
                   nonportable  Convex and Vax programs need this
                   word.  (Debuggers don't; this info is  in  the
                   symbol table.)

              --mmnnooaarrggccoouunntt
                   Omit  the  argument  count  word.  This is the
                   default if you use the unmodified sources.

       --ff_f_l_a_g Specify machine-independent flags.  Most flags have
              both positive and negative forms; the negative form
              of --ffffoooo would be --ffnnoo--ffoooo.  In  the  table  below,
              only  one  of the forms is listed--the one which is
              not the default.  You can figure out the other form
              by either removing nnoo-- or adding it.

       --ffppcccc--ssttrruucctt--rreettuurrnn
              Use  the  same  convention for returning ssttrruucctt and
              uunniioonn values that is used by the usual  C  compiler
              on  your system.  This convention is less efficient
              for small structures, and on many machines it fails
              to be reentrant; but it has the advantage of allow-
              ing intercallability between GCC-compiled code  and
              PCC-compiled code.

       --ffffllooaatt--ssttoorree
              Do not store floating-point variables in registers.
              This  prevents  undesirable  excess  precision   on
              machines  such as the 68000 where the floating reg-
              isters (of the 68881) keep more  precision  than  a
              ddoouubbllee is supposed to have.

              For  most  programs, the excess precision does only
              good, but a few programs rely on the precise  defi-
              nition  of  IEEE floating point.  Use --ffffllooaatt--ssttoorree
              for such programs.

       --ffnnoo--aassmm
              Do not recognize aassmm, iinnlliinnee or ttyyppeeooff  as  a  key-
              word.  These words may then be used as identifiers.
              You can  use  ____aassmm____,  ____iinnlliinnee____  and  ____ttyyppeeooff____
              instead.

       --ffnnoo--ddeeffeerr--ppoopp
              Always  pop  the arguments to each function call as
              soon as that function returns.  Normally  the  com-
              piler  (when  optimizing) lets arguments accumulate
              on the stack for several function  calls  and  pops
              them all at once.

       --ffssttrreennggtthh--rreedduuccee
              Perform  the  optimizations of loop strength reduc-
              tion and elimination of iteration variables.

       --ffccoommbbiinnee--rreeggss
              Allow the combine pass to  combine  an  instruction
              that  copies one register into another.  This might
              or might not produce better code when used in addi-
              tion  to  --OO.  I am interested in hearing about the
              difference this makes.

       --ffffoorrccee--mmeemm
              Force memory operands to be copied  into  registers
              before  doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce
              better code by making all memory references  poten-
              tial common subexpressions.  When they are not com-
              mon subexpressions, instruction combination  should
              eliminate  the separate register-load.  I am inter-
              ested in hearing about the difference this makes.

       --ffffoorrccee--aaddddrr
              Force memory address constants to  be  copied  into
              registers  before  doing  arithmetic on them.  This
              may produce better code just as --ffffoorrccee--mmeemm may.  I
              am  interested in hearing about the difference this
              makes.

              functions  that  don't  need  one.  This avoids the
              instructions to save,  set  up  and  restore  frame
              pointers; it also makes an extra register available
              in many functions.  IItt aallssoo mmaakkeess ddeebbuuggggiinngg  iimmppooss--

              On some machines, such as the Vax, this flag has no
              effect, because the standard calling sequence auto-
              matically  handles the frame pointer and nothing is
              saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The machine-
              description  macro  FFRRAAMMEE__PPOOIINNTTEERR__RREEQQUUIIRREEDD controls
              whether a target machine supports this flag.

       --ffiinnlliinnee--ffuunnccttiioonnss
              Integrate all simple functions into their  callers.
              The  compiler heuristically decides which functions
              are simple enough to be worth integrating  in  this
              way.

              If  all  calls  to a given function are integrated,
              and the function is declared ssttaattiicc, then the func-
              tion  is  normally  not output as assembler code in
              its own right.

       --ffccaalllleerr--ssaavveess
              Enable values to be  allocated  in  registers  that
              will  be  clobbered  by function calls, by emitting
              extra instructions to save and restore  the  regis-
              ters  around  such  calls.  Such allocation is done
              only when it seems to result in  better  code  than
              would otherwise be produced.

              This  option  is  enabled  by  default  on  certain
              machines,  usually  those  which  have   no   call-
              preserved registers to use instead.

       --ffkkeeeepp--iinnlliinnee--ffuunnccttiioonnss
              Even  if  all  calls  to a given function are inte-
              grated, and the function is declared ssttaattiicc, never-
              theless output a separate run-time callable version
              of the function.

       --ffwwrriittaabbllee--ssttrriinnggss
              Store string constants in the writable data segment
              and don't uniquize them.  This is for compatibility
              with old programs which assume they can write  into
              string constants.  Writing into string constants is
              a very bad idea; constants should be constant.

       --ffccoonndd--mmiissmmaattcchh
              Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types
              in  the  second  and third arguments.  The value of
              such an expression is void.

       --ffnnoo--ffuunnccttiioonn--ccssee
              Do not put function addresses  in  registers;  make
              each  instruction  that  calls  a constant function
              contain the function's address explicitly.

              This option results in  less  efficient  code,  but
              some  strange hacks that alter the assembler output
              may be confused by the optimizations performed when
              this option is not used.

       --ffvvoollaattiillee
              Consider  all memory references through pointers to
              be volatile.

       --ffsshhaarreedd--ddaattaa
              Requests that the data and non-ccoonnsstt  variables  of
              this compilation be shared data rather than private
              data.  The distinction makes sense only on  certain
              operating  systems,  where  shared  data  is shared
              between processes running the same  program,  while
              private data exists in one copy per process.

       --ffuunnssiiggnneedd--cchhaarr
              Let  the  type  cchhaarr be the unsigned, like uunnssiiggnneedd
              cchhaarr.

              Each kind of machine has a default  for  what  cchhaarr
              should  be.   It  is  either  like uunnssiiggnneedd cchhaarr by
              default or like ssiiggnneedd cchhaarr by default.  (Actually,
              at present, the default is always signed.)

              The type cchhaarr is always a distinct type from either
              ssiiggnneedd cchhaarr  or  uunnssiiggnneedd  cchhaarr,  even  though  its
              behavior is always just like one of those two.

              Note  that  this is equivalent to --ffnnoo--ssiiggnneedd--cchhaarr,
              which is the negative form of --ffssiiggnneedd--cchhaarr.

       --ffssiiggnneedd--cchhaarr
              Let the type cchhaarr be signed, like ssiiggnneedd cchhaarr.

              Note that this is equivalent to --ffnnoo--uunnssiiggnneedd--cchhaarr,
              which is the negative form of --ffuunnssiiggnneedd--cchhaarr.

              If  supported  for  the  target machine, attempt to

              available after delayed branch instructions.

              Treat  the  register named _r_e_g as a fixed register;
              generated code should never  refer  to  it  (except
              perhaps  as  a  stack  pointer, frame pointer or in
              some other fixed role).

              _r_e_g must be the name of a register.   The  register
              names accepted are machine-specific and are defined
              in the RREEGGIISSTTEERR__NNAAMMEESS macro in the machine descrip-
              tion macro file.

              This flag does not have a negative form, because it
              specifies a three-way choice.

       --ffccaallll--uusseedd--_r_e_g
              Treat the register named _r_e_g as an allocatable reg-
              ister  that is clobbered by function calls.  It may
              be allocated for temporaries or variables  that  do
              not  live  across  a call.  Functions compiled this
              way will not save and restore the register REG.

              Use of this flag for a register that  has  a  fixed
              pervasive  role  in  the machine's execution model,
              such as the stack pointer or  frame  pointer,  will
              produce disastrous results.

              This flag does not have a negative form, because it
              specifies a three-way choice.

              Treat the register named _r_e_g as an allocatable reg-
              ister saved by functions.  It may be allocated even
              for temporaries or variables  that  live  across  a
              call.   Functions  compiled  this way will save and
              restore the register _r_e_g if they use it.

              Use of this flag for a register that  has  a  fixed
              pervasive  role  in  the machine's execution model,
              such as the stack pointer or  frame  pointer,  will
              produce disastrous results.

              A  different  sort of disaster will result from the
              use of this flag for a register in  which  function
              values may be returned.

              This flag does not have a negative form, because it
              specifies a three-way choice.

       --ppeeddaannttiicc
              Issue  all  the  warnings  demanded  by strict ANSI
              standard C; reject all programs that use  forbidden
              extensions.

              Valid ANSI standard C programs should compile prop-
              erly with or without this option (though a rare few
              will require --aannssii).  However, without this option,
              certain GNU extensions and traditional  C  features
              are  supported as well.  With this option, they are
              rejected.  There is no reason to use  this  option;
              it exists only to satisfy pedants.

              --ppeeddaannttiicc  does  not cause warning messages for use
              of the alternate keywords whose names begin and end
              with ____.

       --ssttaattiicc
              On  Suns  running  version 4, this prevents linking
              with  the  shared  libraries.   (--gg  has  the  same
              effect.)

       These  options control the C preprocessor, which is run on
       each C source file before actual compilation.  If you  use
       the  `-E'  option, nothing is done except C preprocessing.
       Some of these options make sense only together  with  `-E'
       because they request preprocessor output that is not suit-
       able for actual compilation.

       --CC     Tell the  preprocessor  not  to  discard  comments.
              Used with the --EE option.

       --II_d_i_r  Search directory _d_i_r for include files.

       --II--    Any  directories  specified  with --II options before
              the --II-- option are searched only for  the  case  of
              ##iinncclluuddee ""_f_i_l_e""; they are not searched for ##iinncclluuddee

              <<_f_i_l_e>>.

              If additional directories  are  specified  with  --II
              options   after  the  --II--,  these  directories  are
              searched for all ##iinncclluuddee directives.   (Ordinarily
              _a_l_l --II directories are used this way.)

              In addition, the --II-- option inhibits the use of the
              current directory as the first search directory for
              ##iinncclluuddee  ""_f_i_l_e"".  Therefore, the current directory
              is searched only if it is requested explicitly with
              --II...   Specifying  both  --II-- and --II..  allows you to
              control precisely which  directories  are  searched
              before  the  current  one  and  which  are searched
              after.

       --nnoossttddiinncc
              Do not search the standard system  directories  for
              header files.  Only the directories you have speci-
              fied with --II options (and the current directory, if
              appropriate) are searched.

              Between  --nnoossttddiinncc  and  --II--, you can eliminate all
              directories from the search path except  those  you
              specify.

       --MM     Tell the preprocessor to output a rule suitable for
              mmaakkee(_1) describing the dependencies of each  source
              file.   For each source file, the preprocessor out-
              puts one mmaakkee-rule whose target is the object  file
              name  for  that  source file and whose dependencies
              are all the files ##iinncclluuddeed in it.  This  rule  may
              be a single line or may be continued with \\--nneewwlliinnee
              if it is long.

              --MM implies --EE.

       --MMMM    Like --MM but the  output  mentions  only  the  user-
              header files included with ##iinncclluuddee ""_f_i_l_e"".  System
              header files  included  with  ##iinncclluuddee  <<_f_i_l_e>>  are
              omitted.

              --MMMM implies --EE.

       --DD_m_a_c_r_o
              Define  macro  _m_a_c_r_o  with  the empty string as its
              definition.

       --DD_m_a_c_r_o=_d_e_f_n
              Define macro _m_a_c_r_o as _d_e_f_n.

       --UU_m_a_c_r_o
              Undefine macro _m_a_c_r_o.
