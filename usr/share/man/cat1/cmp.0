     The cmp utility compares two files of any type and writes the results to
     the standard output.  By default, ccmmpp is silent if the files are the
     same; if they differ, the byte and line number at which the first differ-
     ence occurred is reported.

     Bytes and lines are numbered beginning with one.

     The following options are available:

     --ll      Print the byte number (decimal) and the differing byte values
             (octal) for each difference.

     --ss      Print nothing for differing files; return exit status only.

     If _f_i_l_e_1 or _f_i_l_e_2 is ``-'', the the standard input is used.

     The ccmmpp utility exits with one of the following values:

     0     The files are identical.

     1     The files are different; this includes the case where one file is
           identical to the first part of the other.  In the latter case, if
           the --ss option has not been specified, cmp writes to standard error
           that EOF was reached in the shorter file (before any differences
           were found).

     >1    An error occurred.

     The ccmmpp function is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.
