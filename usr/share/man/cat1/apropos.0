     AApprrooppooss shows which manual pages contain instances of any of the given
     _k_e_y_w_o_r_d(_s) in their title line.  Each word is considered separately and
     case of letters is ignored.  Words which are part of other words are con-
     sidered; when looking for ``compile'', aapprrooppooss will also list all in-
     stances of ``compiler''.

     If the line output by aapprrooppooss starts ``name(section) ...'' you can enter
     ``man section name'' to get its documentation.

     The options are as follows:

     --MM      Override the list of standard directories aapprrooppooss searches for a
             database named _w_h_a_t_i_s._d_b. The supplied _p_a_t_h must be a colon ``:''
             separated list of directories.  This search path may also be set
             using the environment variable MANPATH.

     --mm      Augment the list of standard directories aapprrooppooss searches for its
             database.  The supplied _p_a_t_h must be a colon ``:'' separated list
             of directories.  These directories will be searched before the
             standard directories or the directories supplied with the --MM op-
             tion or the MANPATH environment variable are searched.

     MANPATH  The standard search path used by man(1) may be overridden by
              specifying a path in the MANPATH environment variable.  The for-
              mat of the path is a colon ``:'' separated list of directories.
