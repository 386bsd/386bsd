       The _u_u_s_t_a_t command can display  various  types  of  status
       information about the UUCP system.  It can also be used to
       cancel or rejuvenate requests made by _u_u_c_p (1) or _u_u_x (1).

       By  default  _u_u_s_t_a_t  displays  all  jobs queued up for the
       invoking user, as if given the --uu option with  the  appro-
       priate argument.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The following options may be given to _u_u_s_t_a_t.

       --aa   List all queued jobs.

       --ss ssyysstteemm
            List  all  jobs queued up for the named system.  This
            option may be specified multiple times, in which case
            all jobs for all the systems will be listed.  The --uu,,
            --oo,, and --yy options may be used to restrict which jobs
            are listed.

       --uu uusseerr
            List  all  jobs  queued  up for the named user.  This
            option may be specified multiple times, in which case
            all  jobs  for all the users will be listed.  The --ss,,
            --oo,, and --yy options may be used to restrict which jobs
            are listed.

       --oo hhoouurrss
            List  all  queued jobs older than the given number of
            hours.  The --ss,, --uu,, and --yy options  may  be  used  to
            further restrict which jobs are listed.

       --yy hhoouurrss
            List all queued jobs younger than the given number of
            hours.  The --ss,, --uu,, and --oo options  may  be  used  to
            further restrict which jobs are listed.

       --kk jjoobbiidd
            Kill  the  named job.  The job id is shown by the --ss,,
            --uu,, --oo,, or --yy options, as well as by the --jj option to
            _u_u_c_p (1) or _u_u_x (1).  A job may only be killed by the
            user who created the job, or by the UUCP  administra-
            tor or the superuser.  The --kk option may be used mul-
            tiple times on the command line to kill several jobs.

       --rr jjoobbiidd
            Rejuvenate  the named job.  This will mark it as hav-
            ing been invoked at the current time,  affecting  the
            output of the --oo or --yy options and preserving it from
            any automated cleanup daemon.  The job id is shown by
            the  --ss,,  --uu,, --oo,, or --yy options, as well as by the --jj
            option to _u_u_c_p (1) or _u_u_x (1).  A  job  may  only  be
            rejuvenated  by  the  user who created the job, or by
            the UUCP administrator  or  the  superuser.   The  --rr
            option may be used multiple times on the command line
            to rejuvenate several jobs.

       --qq   Display the status of commands, executions  and  con-
            versations  for all remote systems for which commands
            or executions are queued.

       --mm   Display the status of conversations  for  all  remote
            systems.

       --pp   Display  the  status  of  all  processes holding UUCP
            locks on systems or ports.

       --xx ttyyppee
            Turn on particular debugging  types.   The  following
            types  are  recognized:  abnormal,  chat,  handshake,
            uucp-proto, proto, port, config,  spooldir,  execute,
            incoming,  outgoing.  Only abnormal, config, spooldir
            and execute are meaningful for _u_u_s_t_a_t.

            Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and
            the  --xx  option  may appear multiple times.  A number
            may also be given, which will turn on that many types
            from the foregoing list; for example, --xx 22 is equiva-
            lent to --xx aabbnnoorrmmaall,,cchhaatt..

       --II ffiillee
            Set configuration file to use.  This option  may  not
            be available, depending upon how _u_u_s_t_a_t was compiled.

       uustat -a Display status of all  jobs.   A  sample  output
       line is as follows: bugsA027h bugs ian 1992-04-01 13:50:04

       The --ss,, --uu,, --oo,, and --yy options also produce output in  the
       above format.

       uustat  -q  Display  status for all systems with queued up
       commands.  A sample output line is as follows: bugs 4C  (1
       hour)  0X  (0  secs)  1992-04-01 14:45:47 Dial failed This
       indicates the system, the number of queued  commands,  the
       age  of  the  oldest  queued command, the number of queued
       local executions, the age of the oldest queued  execution,
       the  date of the last conversation, and the status of that
       conversation.

       uustat -m Display conversation status for all remote  sys-
       tems.  A sample output line is as follows: bugs 1992-04-01
       15:51:30 Conversation complete This indicates the  system,
       the  date of the last conversation, and the status of that
       conversation.  If the  last  conversation  failed,  _u_u_s_t_a_t
       will indicate how many attempts have been made to call the
       system.  If the retry period is currently preventing calls
       to  that  system,  _u_u_s_t_a_t  also displays the time when the
       next call will be permitted.

       uustat -p Display the status of all processes holding UUCP
       locks.   The  output format is system dependent, as _u_u_s_t_a_t
       simply invokes _p_s (1) on each process holding a lock.

       The file names may be changed at compilation  time  or  by
       the  configuration file, so these are only approximations.

       /usr/lib/uucp/config - Configuration file.
       /usr/spool/uucp - UUCP spool directory.
