       _M_e_r_g_e  incorporates  all  changes  that lead form _f_i_l_e_2 to
       _f_i_l_e_3 into _f_i_l_e_1. The result goes to std. output if --pp  is
       present, into _f_i_l_e_1 otherwise. _M_e_r_g_e is useful for combin-
       ing separate changes to an original. Suppose _f_i_l_e_2 is  the
       original,  and  both  _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_3 are modifications of
       _f_i_l_e_2. Then _m_e_r_g_e combines both changes.

       An overlap occurs if both _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_3 have changes  in
       a common segment of lines.  _M_e_r_g_e prints how many overlaps
       occurred, and includes both alternatives  in  the  result.
       The alternatives are delimited as follows:

               <<<<<<< file1
               lines in file1
               =======
               lines in file3
               >>>>>>> file3

       If there are overlaps, the user should edit the result and
       delete one of the alternatives.
