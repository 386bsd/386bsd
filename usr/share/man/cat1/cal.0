     CCaall displays a simple calendar.  If arguments are not specified, the cur-
     rent month is displayed.  The options are as follows:

     --jj      Display julian dates (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     --yy      Display a calendar for the current year.

     A single parameter specifies the year (1 - 9999) to be displayed; note
     the year must be fully specified: ``cal 89'' will _n_o_t display a calendar
     for 1989.  Two parameters denote the month (1 - 12) and year.  If no pa-
     rameters are specified, the current month's calendar is displayed.

     A year starts on Jan 1.

     The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in 1752 on the 3rd
     of September.  By this time, most countries had recognized the reforma-
     tion (although a few did not recognize it until the early 1900's.)  Ten
     days following that date were eliminated by the reformation, so the cal-
     endar for that month is a bit unusual.
