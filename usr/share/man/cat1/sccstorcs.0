       sccstorcs - build RCS file from SCCS file

       _S_c_c_s_t_o_r_c_s builds an RCS file from each SCCS file argument.
       The deltas and comments for each delta are  preserved  and
       installed  into the new RCS file in order.  Also preserved
       are the user access list and  descriptive  text,  if  any,
       from the SCCS file.

       The following flags are meaningful:

       --tt     Trace  only.  Prints detailed information about the
              SCCS file and lists the commands that would be exe-
              cuted  to  produce  the  RCS file.  No commands are
              actually executed and no RCS file is made.

       --vv     Verbose.  Prints each command that is run while  it
              is building the RCS file.

       For  each  s._s_o_m_e_f_i_l_e, _S_c_c_s_t_o_r_c_s writes the files _s_o_m_e_f_i_l_e
       and _s_o_m_e_f_i_l_e,v which should not already exist.   _S_c_c_s_t_o_r_c_s
       will  abort,  rather than overwrite those files if they do
       exist.

       All diagnostics are written to stderr.  Non-zero exit sta-
       tus on error.

BBUUGGSS
       _S_c_c_s_t_o_r_c_s does not preserve all SCCS options specified  in
       the SCCS file.  Most notably, it does not preserve removed
       deltas, MR numbers, and cutoff points.
