     The nneettssttaatt command symbolically displays the contents of various
     network-related data structures.  There are a number of output formats,
     depending on the options for the information presented.  The first form
     of the command displays a list of active sockets for each protocol.  The
     second form presents the contents of one of the other network data
     structures according to the option selected.  Using the third form, with
     a _w_a_i_t interval specified, nneettssttaatt will continuously display the
     information regarding packet traffic on the configured network
     interfaces.  The fourth form displays statistics about the named
     protocol.

     The options have the following meaning:

     --AA    With the default display, show the address of any protocol control
           blocks associated with sockets; used for debugging.

     --aa    With the default display, show the state of all sockets; normally
           sockets used by server processes are not shown.

     --dd    With either interface display (option --ii or an interval, as
           described below), show the number of dropped packets.

     --hh    Show the state of the IMP host table.

     --ii    Show the state of interfaces which have been auto-configured
           (interfaces statically configured into a system, but not located at
           boot time are not shown).

     --II _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e
           Show information only about this interface; used with an _w_a_i_t
           interval as described below.

     --MM    Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
           core instead of the default /_d_e_v/_k_m_e_m.

     --mm    Show statistics recorded by the memory management routines (the
           network manages a private pool of memory buffers).

     --NN    Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the
           default /_v_m_u_n_i_x.

     --nn    Show network addresses as numbers (normally nneettssttaatt interprets
           addresses and attempts to display them symbolically).  This option
           may be used with any of the display formats.

     --pp _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
           Show statistics about _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l, which is either a well-known name
           for a protocol or an alias for it.  Some protocol names and aliases
           are listed in the file /_e_t_c/_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s. A null response typically
           means that there are no interesting numbers to report.  The program
           will complain if _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l is unknown or if there is no statistics


           routine for it.

     --ss    Show per-protocol statistics.

     --rr    Show the routing tables.  When --ss is also present, show routing
           statistics instead.

     --ff _a_d_d_r_e_s_s__f_a_m_i_l_y
           Limit statistics or address control block reports to those of the
           specified _a_d_d_r_e_s_s _f_a_m_i_l_y. The following address families are
           recognized: _i_n_e_t, for AF_INET, _n_s, for AF_NS, and _u_n_i_x, for
           AF_UNIX.

     The default display, for active sockets, shows the local and remote
     addresses, send and receive queue sizes (in bytes), protocol, and the
     internal state of the protocol.  Address formats are of the form
     ``host.port'' or ``network.port'' if a socket's address specifies a
     network but no specific host address.  When known the host and network
     addresses are displayed symbolically according to the data bases
     /_e_t_c/_h_o_s_t_s and /_e_t_c/_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, respectively.  If a symbolic name for an
     address is unknown, or if the --nn option is specified, the address is
     printed numerically, according to the address family.  For more
     information regarding the Internet ``dot format,'' refer to inet(3)).
     Unspecified, or ``wildcard'', addresses and ports appear as ``*''.

     The interface display provides a table of cumulative statistics regarding
     packets transferred, errors, and collisions.  The network addresses of
     the interface and the maximum transmission unit (``mtu'') are also
     displayed.

     The routing table display indicates the available routes and their
     status.  Each route consists of a destination host or network and a
     gateway to use in forwarding packets.  The flags field shows the state of
     the route (``U'' if ``up''), whether the route is to a gateway (``G''),
     whether the route was created dynamically by a redirect (``D''), and
     whether the route has been modified by a redirect (``M'').  Direct routes
     are created for each interface attached to the local host; the gateway
     field for such entries shows the address of the outgoing interface.  The
     refcnt field gives the current number of active uses of the route.
     Connection oriented protocols normally hold on to a single route for the
     duration of a connection while connectionless protocols obtain a route
     while sending to the same destination.  The use field provides a count of
     the number of packets sent using that route.  The interface entry
     indicates the network interface utilized for the route.

     When nneettssttaatt is invoked with a _w_a_i_t interval argument, it displays a
     running count of statistics related to network interfaces.  This display
     consists of a column for the primary interface (the first interface found
     during autoconfiguration) and a column summarizing information for all
     interfaces.  The primary interface may be replaced with another interface
     with the --II option.  The first line of each screen of information
     contains a summary since the system was last rebooted.  Subsequent lines
     of output show values accumulated over the preceding interval.

     The notion of errors is ill-defined.

     Collisions mean something else for the IMP.
