     NNaammeedd is the Internet domain name server.  See _R_F_C_8_8_3 for more
     information on the Internet name-domain system.  Without any arguments,
     nnaammeedd will read the default boot file /_e_t_c/_n_a_m_e_d._b_o_o_t, read any initial
     data and listen for queries.

     Options are:

     --dd      Print debugging information.  A number after the --dd determines
             the level of messages printed.

     --pp      Use a different port number.  The default is the standard port
             number as listed in /_e_t_c/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s.

     --bb      Use an alternate boot file.  This is optional and allows you to
             specify a file with a leading dash.

     Any additional argument is taken as the name of the boot file.  The boot
     file contains information about where the name server is to get its
     initial data.  If multiple boot files are specified, only the last is
     used.  Lines in the boot file cannot be continued on subsequent lines.
     The following is a small example:

     ;
     ;       boot file for name server
     ;
     directory       /etc/namedb

     ; type  domain  source host/file                      backup file

     cache   .                                             root.cache
     primary   Berkeley.EDU          berkeley.edu.zone
     primary   32.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA   ucbhosts.rev
     secondary CC.Berkeley.EDU 128.32.137.8 128.32.137.3 cc.zone.bak
     secondary 6.32.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA 128.32.137.8 128.32.137.3 cc.rev.bak
     primary   0.0.127.IN-ADDR.ARPA localhost.rev
     forwarders 10.0.0.78 10.2.0.78
     ; slave

     The ``directory'' line causes the server to change its working directory
     to the directory specified.  This can be important for the correct
     processing of $INCLUDE files in primary zone files.

     The ``cache'' line specifies that data in ``_r_o_o_t._c_a_c_h_e'' is to be placed
     in the backup cache.  Its main use is to specify data such as locations
     of root domain servers.  This cache is not used during normal operation,
     but is used as ``hints'' to find the current root servers.  The file
     ``_r_o_o_t._c_a_c_h_e'' is in the same format as ``_b_e_r_k_e_l_e_y._e_d_u._z_o_n_e''. There can
     be more than one ``cache'' file specified.  The cache files are processed
     in such a way as to preserve the time-to-live's of data dumped out.  Data
     for the root nameservers is kept artificially valid if necessary.

     The first ``primary'' line states that the file ``_b_e_r_k_e_l_e_y._e_d_u._z_o_n_e''
     contains authoritative data for the ``Berkeley._E_D_U'' zone.  The file
     ``_b_e_r_k_e_l_e_y._e_d_u._z_o_n_e'' contains data in the master file format described
     in _R_F_C_8_8_3. All domain names are relative to the origin, in this case,
     ``Berkeley._E_D_U'' (see below for a more detailed description).  The second
     ``primary'' line states that the file ``_u_c_b_h_o_s_t_s._r_e_v'' contains
     authoritative data for the domain ``32.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA'', which is used
     to translate addresses in network 128.32 to hostnames.  Each master file
     should begin with an SOA record for the zone (see below).

     The first ``secondary'' line specifies that all authoritative data under
     ``CC.Berkeley._E_D_U'' is to be transferred from the name server at
     128.32.137.8.  If the transfer fails it will try 128.32.137.3 and
     continue trying the addresses, up to 10, listed on this line.  The
     secondary copy is also authoritative for the specified domain.  The first
     non-dotted-quad address on this line will be taken as a filename in which
     to backup the transfered zone.  The name server will load the zone from
     this backup file if it exists when it boots, providing a complete copy
     even if the master servers are unreachable.  Whenever a new copy of the
     domain is received by automatic zone transfer from one of the master
     servers, this file will be updated.  The second ``secondary'' line states
     that the address-to-hostname mapping for the subnet 128.32.136 should be
     obtained from the same list of master servers as the previous zone.

     The ``forwarders'' line specifies the addresses of sitewide servers that
     will accept recursive queries from other servers.  If the boot file
     specifies one or more forwarders, then the server will send all queries
     for data not in the cache to the forwarders first.  Each forwarder will
     be asked in turn until an answer is returned or the list is exhausted.
     If no answer is forthcoming from a forwarder, the server will continue as
     it would have without the forwarders line unless it is in ``slave'' mode.
     The forwarding facility is useful to cause a large sitewide cache to be
     generated on a master, and to reduce traffic over links to outside
     servers.  It can also be used to allow servers to run that do not have
     access directly to the Internet, but wish to act as though they do.

     The ``slave'' line (shown commented out) is used to put the server in
     slave mode.  In this mode, the server will only make queries to
     forwarders.  This option is normally used on machine that wish to run a
     server but for physical or administrative reasons cannot be given access
     to the Internet, but have access to a host that does have access.

     The ``sortlist'' line can be used to indicate networks that are to be
     preferred over other, unlisted networks.  Queries for host addresses from
     hosts on the same network as the server will receive responses with local
     network addresses listed first, then addresses on the sort list, then
     other addresses.  This line is only acted on at initial startup.  When
     reloading the nameserver with a SIGHUP, this line will be ignored.

     The master file consists of control information and a list of resource
     records for objects in the zone of the forms:

     $INCLUDE <filename> <opt_domain>
     $ORIGIN <domain>
     <domain> <opt_ttl> <opt_class> <type> <resource_record_data>

     where _d_o_m_a_i_n is `.' for root, `@' for the current origin, or a standard
     domain name. If _d_o_m_a_i_n is a standard domain name that does not end with
     `.', the current origin is appended to the domain. Domain names ending
     with `.' are unmodified.  The _o_p_t__d_o_m_a_i_n field is used to define an
     origin for the data in an included file.  It is equivalent to placing a
     $ORIGIN statement before the first line of the included file.  The field
     is optional.  Neither the _o_p_t__d_o_m_a_i_n field nor $ORIGIN statements in the
     included file modify the current origin for this file.  The _o_p_t__t_t_l field
     is an optional integer number for the time-to-live field.  It defaults to
     zero, meaning the minimum value specified in the SOA record for the zone.
     The _o_p_t__c_l_a_s_s field is the object address type; currently only one type
     is supported, IINN, for objects connected to the DARPA Internet.  The _t_y_p_e
     field contains one of the following tokens; the data expected in the


     _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e__r_e_c_o_r_d__d_a_t_a field is in parentheses.

     A           a host address (dotted quad)

     NS          an authoritative name server (domain)

     MX          a mail exchanger (domain)

     CNAME       the canonical name for an alias (domain)

     SOA         marks the start of a zone of authority (domain of originating
                 host, domain address of maintainer, a serial number and the
                 following parameters in seconds: refresh, retry, expire and
                 minimum TTL (see _R_F_C_8_8_3))

     MB          a mailbox domain name (domain)

     MG          a mail group member (domain)

     MR          a mail rename domain name (domain)

     NULL        ra null resource record (no format or data)

     WKS         a well know service description (not implemented yet)

     PTR         a domain name pointer (domain)

     HINFO       host information (cpu_type OS_type )

     MINFO       mailbox or mail list information (request_domain
                 error_domain)

     Resource records normally end at the end of a line, but may be continued
     across lines between opening and closing parentheses.  Comments are
     introduced by semicolons and continue to the end of the line.

     Each master zone file should begin with an SOA record for the zone.  An
     example SOA record is as follows:

     @  IN  SOA  ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU. rwh.ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU. (
                                  2.89       ; serial
                                  10800      ; refresh
                                  3600       ; retry
                                  3600000    ; expire
                                  86400 )    ; minimum

     The SOA lists a serial number, which should be changed each time the
     master file is changed.  Secondary servers check the serial number at
     intervals specified by the refresh time in seconds; if the serial number
     changes, a zone transfer will be done to load the new data.  If a master
     server cannot be contacted when a refresh is due, the retry time
     specifies the interval at which refreshes should be attempted until
     successful.  If a master server cannot be contacted within the interval
     given by the expire time, all data from the zone is discarded by
     secondary servers.  The minimum value is the time-to-live used by records
     in the file with no explicit time-to-live value.

NNOOTTEESS
     The boot file directives ``domain'' and ``suffixes'' have been obsoleted
     by a more useful resolver based implementation of suffixing for partially
     qualified domain names.  The prior mechanisms could fail under a number
     of situations, especially when then local nameserver did not have
     complete information.

     The following signals have the specified effect when sent to the server

     process using the kill(1) command.

     SIGHUP      Causes server to read _n_a_m_e_d._b_o_o_t and reload database.

     SIGINT      Dumps current data base and cache to /_v_a_r/_t_m_p/_n_a_m_e_d__d_u_m_p._d_b

     SIGIOT      Dumps statistics data into /_v_a_r/_t_m_p/_n_a_m_e_d._s_t_a_t_s if the server
                 is compiled -DSTATS. Statistics data is appended to the file.

     SIGSYS      Dumps the profiling data in /_v_a_r/_t_m_p if the server is
                 compiled with profiling (server forks, chdirs and exits).

     SIGTERM     Dumps the primary and secondary database files.  Used to save
                 modified data on shutdown if the server is compiled with
                 dynamic updating enabled.

     SIGUSR1     urnsTurns on debugging; each SIGUSR1 increments debug level.
                 (SIGEMT on older systems without SIGUSR1)

     SIGUSR2     Turns off debugging completely.  (SIGFPE on older systems
                 without SIGUSR2)
