     TTiimmeeddcc is used to control the operation of the timed(8) program.  It may
     be used to:

     oo   Measure the differences between machines' clocks,

     oo   Find the location where the master time server is running,

     oo   Enable or disable tracing of messages received by timed,  and

     oo   Perform various debugging actions.

     Without any arguments, ttiimmeeddcc will prompt for commands from the standard
     input.  If arguments are supplied, ttiimmeeddcc interprets the first argument
     as a command and the remaining arguments as parameters to the command.
     The standard input may be redirected causing ttiimmeeddcc to read commands from
     a file.  Commands may be abbreviated; recognized commands are:

     ?? [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d ...]
     hheellpp [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d ...]
             Print a short description of each command specified in the
             argument list, or, if no arguments are given, a list of the
             recognized commands.

     cclloocckkddiiffff _h_o_s_t ...
             Compute the differences between the clock of the host machine and
             the clocks of the machines given as arguments.

     ttrraaccee { _o_n | _o_f_f }
             Enable or disable the tracing of incoming messages to timed in
             the file /_v_a_r/_l_o_g/_t_i_m_e_d._l_o_g.

     qquuiitt    Exit from timedc.

     Other commands may be included for use in testing and debugging timed;
     the help command and the program source may be consulted for details.
