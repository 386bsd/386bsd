       _D_i_s_k_l_a_b_e_l can be used to install, examine  or  modify  the
       label on a disk drive or pack.  When writing the label, it
       can be used to change the drive identification,  the  disk
       partitions  on the drive, or to replace a damaged label or
       bootstrap.  The disk label is located on one of the  first
       sectors  of each disk (usually block 0).  On machines that
       require a block-0 bootstrap (VAX  11/750),  the  label  is
       inserted  into the bootstrap program.  This information is
       used by the  system  disk  driver  and  by  the  bootstrap
       program  to determine how to program the drive.  There are
       several forms of the  command  that  display,  install  or
       modify  the  label on a disk.  Each form has an additional
       option, --rr, which causes the label  to  be  read  from  or
       written  to  the  disk directly, rather than going through
       the system's in-core copy of the label.  When writing, the
       in-core copy is also updated if possible.  This option may
       allow a label to be installed on  a  disk  without  kernel
       support  for  a  label,  such  as  when  labels  are first
       installed  on  a  system;  it  must  be  used  when  first
       installing a label on a disk.

       The first form of the command is used to examine the label
       on the named disk drive (e.g. hp0 or /dev/rhp0c).  It will
       display  all  of  the parameters associated with the drive
       and its partition layout.  Unless the --rr  flag  is  given,
       the  kernel's  in-core  copy of the label is displayed; if
       the disk has no label, or the partition types on the  disk
       are incorrect, the kernel may have constructed or modified
       the label.  If the --rr flag is given, the  label  from  the
       raw  disk will be displayed rather than the in-core label.

       The second form of the command, with the --ww flag, is  used
       to  write  a  standard label on the designated drive.  The
       required arguments  to  _d_i_s_k_l_a_b_e_l  are  the  drive  to  be
       labelled  (e.g.  hp0),  and the drive type as described in
       the _d_i_s_k_t_a_b(5) file.  The drive parameters and  partitions
       are  taken from that file.  If different disks of the same
       physical type are to have different partitions, it will be
       necessary  to  have  separate  disktab  entries describing
       each, or to edit the label after installation as described
       below.    The   first   optional   argument   is   a  pack
       identification string, up to 16 characters long.  The pack

       id  must  be quoted if it contains blanks.  If the --rr flag
       is given,  the  disk  sectors  containing  the  label  and
       bootstrap will be written directly, otherwise the existing
       label will be  updated  in  place  without  modifying  the
       bootstrap.  If the disk does not already have a label, the
       --rr flag must be used.  In either case,  the  kernel's  in-
       core label is replaced.

       Alternate versions of the bootstrap files may be specified
       after the pack identifier.  If an alternate  bootstrap  is
       not  specified,  the standard bootstrap will be used.  The
       bootstrap programs are located in /_u_s_r/_m_d_e_c.  The names of
       the  bootstrap programs may be specified in _d_i_s_k_t_a_b(5); if
       not  specified,  the  default  names  are  of   the   form
       _b_a_s_e_n_a_m_eboot  for  the  primary  (block  0) bootstrap, and
       boot_b_a_s_e_n_a_m_e for the secondary (block 1-15) bootstrap; for
       example, /usr/mdec/hpboot and /usr/mdec/boothp if the disk
       device is hhpp00.

       An existing disk label may be edited by using the --ee flag.
       The  label  is  read  from  the  in-core  kernel  copy, or
       directly from the disk if the --rr flag is also given.   The
       label  is  formatted  and  then  supplied to an editor for
       changes.   If  no  editor  is  specified  in   an   EDITOR
       environment  variable,  _v_i(1)  is  used.   When the editor
       terminates, the formatted label  is  reread  and  used  to
       rewrite the disk label.

       With the --RR flag, _d_i_s_k_l_a_b_e_l is capable of restoring a disk
       label that was formatted in a prior operation and saved in
       an  ascii  file.   The  prototype  file used to create the
       label should be in the same format as that  produced  when
       reading  or  editing a label.  Comments are delimited by ##
       and newline.  If the --rr option is also  given,  a  block-0
       bootstrap  is  installed  on machines that use one; either
       the disktype or the names of the bootstrap files  must  be
       specified on such machines.

       Finally,  the  --NNWW flags for _d_i_s_k_l_a_b_e_l explicitly disallow
       and allow, respectively, writing of the pack label area on
       the selected disk.

       drivers create a label  containing  only  a  single  large
       partition  if a disk is unlabeled; thus, the label must be
       written to the ``a'' partition of the  disk  while  it  is
       open.  This sometimes requires the desired label to be set
       in two steps, the first one creating at  least  one  other
       partition,  and  the  second  setting the label on the new
       partition while shrinking the ``a'' partition.

       When a disk name is given without  a  full  pathname,  the
       constructed  device  name  uses the ``c'' partition on the
       vax and the ``a'' partition on the tahoe.
