       uuxqt - UUCP execution daemon

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _u_u_x_q_t  daemon  executes commands requested by _u_u_x (1)
       from either the local system or from remote  systems.   It
       is  started automatically by the _u_u_c_i_c_o (8) daemon (unless
       _u_u_c_i_c_o (8) is given the --qq option).

       There is normally no need to run this  command,  since  it
       will be invoked by _u_u_c_i_c_o (8).  However, it can be used to
       provide greater control over the processing  of  the  work
       queue.

       Multiple  invocations of _u_u_x_q_t may be run at once, as con-
       trolled by the _m_a_x-_u_u_x_q_t_s configuration command.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The following options may be given to _u_u_x_q_t.

       --cc ccoommmmaanndd
            Only execute requests for the specified command.  For
            example: uuxqt -c rmail

       --ss ssyysstteemm
            Only  execute requests originating from the specified
            system.

       --xx ttyyppee
            Turn on particular debugging  types.   The  following
            types  are  recognized:  abnormal,  chat,  handshake,
            uucp-proto, proto, port, config,  spooldir,  execute,
            incoming,  outgoing.  Only abnormal, config, spooldir
            and execute are meaningful for _u_u_x_q_t.

            Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and
            the  --xx  option  may appear multiple times.  A number
            may also be given, which will turn on that many types
            from the foregoing list; for example, --xx 22 is equiva-
            lent to --xx aabbnnoorrmmaall,,cchhaatt..

            The debugging output is sent to the  debugging  file,
            usually       one      of      /usr/spool/uucp/Debug,
            /usr/spool/uucp/DEBUG,                             or
            /usr/spool/uucp/.Admin/audit.local.

       --II ffiillee
            Set  configuration  file to use.  This option may not
            be available, depending upon how _u_u_x_q_t was  compiled.

       The  file  names  may be changed at compilation time or by
       the configuration file, so these are only  approximations.

       /usr/lib/uucp/config - Configuration file.
       /usr/spool/uucp - UUCP spool directory.
       /usr/spool/uucp/Log - UUCP log file.
       /usr/spool/uucppublic - Default UUCP public directory.
       /usr/spool/uucp/Debug - Debugging file.
