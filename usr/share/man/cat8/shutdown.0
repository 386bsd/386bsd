     SShhuuttddoowwnn provides an automated shutdown procedure for super-users to
     nicely notify users when the system is shutting down, saving them from
     system administrators, hackers, and gurus, who would otherwise not bother
     with such niceties.

     Available friendlinesses:

     --ff    SShhuuttddoowwnn arranges, in the manner of fastboot(8),  for the file
           systems _n_o_t _t_o _b_e checked on reboot.

     --hh    The system is halted at the specified _t_i_m_e when sshhuuttddoowwnn execs
           halt(8).

     --kk    Kick every body off.  The --kk option does not actually halt the
           system, but leaves the system multi-user with logins disabled (for
           all but super-user).

     --nn    Prevent the normal sync(2) before stopping.

     --rr    SShhuuttddoowwnn execs reboot(8) at the specified _t_i_m_e.

     _t_i_m_e  _T_i_m_e is the time at which sshhuuttddoowwnn will bring the system down and
           may be the word _n_o_w (indicating an immediate shutdown) or specify a
           future time in one of two formats: +_n_u_m_b_e_r, or _y_y_m_m_d_d_h_h_m_m, where
           the year, month, and day may be defaulted to the current system
           values.  The first form brings the system down in _n_u_m_b_e_r minutes
           and the second at the absolute time specified.

     _w_a_r_n_i_n_g-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e
           Any other arguments comprise the warning message that is broadcast
           to users currently logged into the system.

     --     If `--' is supplied as an option, the warning message is read from
           the standard input.

     At intervals, becoming more frequent as apocalypse approaches and
     starting at ten hours before shutdown, warning messages are displayed on
     the terminals of all users logged in.  Five minutes before shutdown, or
     immediately if shutdown is in less than 5 minutes, logins are disabled by
     creating /_e_t_c/_n_o_l_o_g_i_n and copying the warning message there.  If this
     file exists when a user attempts to log in, login(1) prints its contents
     and exits.  The file is removed just before sshhuuttddoowwnn exits.

     At shutdown time a message is written in the system log, containing the
     time of shutdown, who initiated the shutdown and the reason.  A terminate
     signal is then sent to init to bring the system down to single-user state
     (depending on above options).  The time of the shutdown and the warning
     message are placed in /_e_t_c/_n_o_l_o_g_i_n and should be used to inform the users
     about when the system will be back up and why it is going down (or
     anything else).

     The hours and minutes in the second time format may be separated by a
     colon (``:'') for backward compatibility.
