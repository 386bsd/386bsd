     aadddduusseerr - procedure for adding new users

     A new user must choose a login name, which must not already appear in
     /_e_t_c/_p_a_s_s_w_d or /_e_t_c/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s. It must also not begin with the hyphen `--'
     character.  It is strongly recommended that it be all lower-case, and not
     contain the dot `.' character, as that tends to confuse mailers.  An ac-
     count can be added by editing a line into the passwd file; this must be
     done with the password file locked e.g. by using chpass(1) or vipw(8).

     A new user is given a group and user id.  Login and user id's should be
     unique across the system, and often across a group of systems, since they
     are used to control file access.  Typically, users working on similar
     projects will be put in the same groups.  At the University of Califor-
     nia, Berkeley, we have groups for system staff, faculty, graduate stu-
     dents, and special groups for large projects.

     A skeletal account for a new user ernie might look like:

     ernie::25:30::0:0:Ernie Kovacs,508 Evans Hall,x7925,
             642-8202:/a/users/ernie:/bin/csh

     For a description of each of these fields, see passwd(5).

     It is useful to give new users some help in getting started, supplying
     them with a few skeletal files such as ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e if they use /_b_i_n/_s_h, or
     ._c_s_h_r_c and ._l_o_g_i_n if they use /_b_i_n/_c_s_h. The directory /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_s_k_e_l
     contains skeletal definitions of such files.  New users should be given
     copies of these files which, for instance, use tset(1) automatically at
     each login.

     User information should (and eventually will) be stored elsewhere.
