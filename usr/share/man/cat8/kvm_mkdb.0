     KKvvmm__mmkkddbb creates a database in /_v_a_r/_r_u_n containing information about
     /_v_m_u_n_i_x and perhaps other fairly static information about the current
     system.  Various library routines consult this database.  The only infor-
     mation currently stored is the kernel namelist, which is used by the
     kvm_nlist(3) function.
