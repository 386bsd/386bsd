     SSyynncc can be called to insure that all disk writes have been completed be-
     fore the processor is halted in a way not suitably done by reboot(8) or
     halt(8).  Generally, it is preferable to use reboot or halt to shut down
     the system, as they may perform additional actions such as resynchroniz-
     ing the hardware clock and flushing internal caches before performing a
     final ssyynncc.

     SSyynncc utilizes the sync(2) function call.
