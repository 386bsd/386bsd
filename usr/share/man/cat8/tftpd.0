     TTffttppdd is a server which supports the DARPA Trivial File Transfer
     Protocol.  The TFTP server operates at the port indicated in the `tftp'
     service description; see services(5).  The server is normally started by
     inetd(8).

     The use of tftp(1) does not require an account or password on the remote
     system.  Due to the lack of authentication information, ttffttppdd will allow
     only publicly readable files to be accessed.  Files may be written only
     if they already exist and are publicly writable.  Note that this extends
     the concept of ``public'' to include all users on all hosts that can be
     reached through the network; this may not be appropriate on all systems,
     and its implications should be considered before enabling tftp service.
     The server should have the user ID with the lowest possible privilege.

     Access to files may be restricted by invoking ttffttppdd with a list of
     directories by including pathnames as server program arguments in
     /_e_t_c/_i_n_e_t_d._c_o_n_f. In this case access is restricted to files whose names
     are prefixed by the one of the given directories.
