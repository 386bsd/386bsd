     RRmmtt is a program used by the remote dump and restore programs in manipu-
     lating a magnetic tape drive through an interprocess communication con-
     nection.  RRmmtt is normally started up with an rexec(3) or rcmd(3) call.

     The rrmmtt program accepts requests specific to the manipulation of magnetic
     tapes, performs the commands, then responds with a status indication.
     All responses are in ASCII and in one of two forms.  Successful commands
     have responses of:

           AA_n_u_m_b_e_r\n

     _N_u_m_b_e_r is an ASCII representation of a decimal number.  Unsuccessful com-
     mands are responded to with:

           EE_e_r_r_o_r-_n_u_m_b_e_r\n_e_r_r_o_r-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e\n

     _E_r_r_o_r-_n_u_m_b_e_r is one of the possible error numbers described in intro(2)
     and _e_r_r_o_r-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e is the corresponding error string as printed from a
     call to perror(3).  The protocol is comprised of the following commands,
     which are sent as indicated - no spaces are supplied between the command
     and its arguments, or between its arguments, and `\n' indicates that a
     newline should be supplied:

     OO_d_e_v_i_c_e\n_m_o_d_e\n
             Open the specified _d_e_v_i_c_e using the indicated _m_o_d_e. _D_e_v_i_c_e is a
             full pathname and _m_o_d_e is an ASCII representation of a decimal
             number suitable for passing to open(2).  If a device had already
             been opened, it is closed before a new open is performed.

     CC_d_e_v_i_c_e\n
             Close the currently open device.  The _d_e_v_i_c_e specified is ig-
             nored.

     LL_w_h_e_n_c_e\n_o_f_f_s_e_t\n
             Perform an lseek(2) operation using the specified parameters.
             The response value is that returned from the lseek call.

     WW_c_o_u_n_t\n
             Write data onto the open device.  RRmmtt reads _c_o_u_n_t bytes from the
             connection, aborting if a premature end-of-file is encountered.
             The response value is that returned from the write(2) call.

     RR_c_o_u_n_t\n
             Read _c_o_u_n_t bytes of data from the open device.  If _c_o_u_n_t exceeds
             the size of the data buffer (10 kilobytes), it is truncated to
             the data buffer size.  rrmmtt then performs the requested read(2)
             and responds with AA_c_o_u_n_t-_r_e_a_d\n if the read was successful;
             otherwise an error in the standard format is returned.  If the
             read was successful, the data read is then sent.

     II_o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n\n_c_o_u_n_t\n
             Perform a MTIOCOP ioctl(2) command using the specified parame-
             ters.  The parameters are interpreted as the ASCII representa-
             tions of the decimal values to place in the _m_t__o_p and _m_t__c_o_u_n_t
             fields of the structure used in the ioctl call.  The return value

             is the _c_o_u_n_t parameter when the operation is successful.

     SS       Return the status of the open device, as obtained with a MTIOCGET
             ioctl call.  If the operation was successful, an ``ack'' is sent
             with the size of the status buffer, then the status buffer is
             sent (in binary).

     Any other command causes rrmmtt to exit.
