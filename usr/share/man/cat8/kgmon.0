     KKggmmoonn is a tool used when profiling the operating system.  When no
     arguments are supplied, kkggmmoonn indicates the state of operating system
     profiling as running, off, or not configured.  (see config(8))  If the --pp
     flag is specified, kkggmmoonn extracts profile data from the operating system
     and produces a _g_m_o_n._o_u_t file suitable for later analysis by gprof(1).

     The options are as follows:

     --bb      Resume the collection of profile data.

     --hh      Stop the collection of profile data.

     --pp      Dump the contents of the profile buffers into a _g_m_o_n._o_u_t file.

     --rr      Reset all the profile buffers.  If the --pp flag is also specified,
             the _g_m_o_n._o_u_t file is generated before the buffers are reset.

     --MM      Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
             core instead of the default ``/dev/kmem''.

     --NN      Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the
             default ``/vmunix''.

     If neither --bb nor --hh is specified, the state of profiling collection
     remains unchanged.  For example, if the --pp flag is specified and profile
     data is being collected, profiling will be momentarily suspended, the
     operating system profile buffers will be dumped, and profiling will be
     immediately resumed.

     Users with only read permission on /_d_e_v/_k_m_e_m cannot change the state of
     profiling collection.  They can get a _g_m_o_n._o_u_t file with the warning that
     the data may be inconsistent if profiling is in progress.

     The kkggmmoonn command appeared in 4.2BSD.
