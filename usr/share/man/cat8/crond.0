       _C_r_o_n_d should be started from /etc/rc or /etc/rc.local.  It
       will return immediately, so you don't  need  to  start  it
       with '&'.

       _C_r_o_n_d  searches /var/cron/tabs for crontab files which are
       named after accounts in /etc/passwd;  crontabs  found  are
       loaded  into  memory.   _C_r_o_n_d  then wakes up every minute,
       examining all stored crontabs, checking  each  command  to
       see  if it should be run in the current minute.  When exe-
       cuting commands, any output is mailed to the owner of  the
       crontab  (or  to  the user named in the MAILTO environment
       variable in the crontab, if such exists).

       Additionally, _c_r_o_n_d checks each minute to see if its spool
       directory's modtime has changed, and if it has, _c_r_o_n_d will
       then examine the modtime on all crontabs and reload  those
       which  have  changed.   Thus  _c_r_o_n_d  need not be restarted
       whenever a  crontab  file  is  modified.   Note  that  the
       _C_r_o_n_t_a_b(1) command updates the modtime of the spool direc-
       tory whenever it changes a crontab.
