       The  first  form of _f_s_c_k preens a standard set of filesys-
       tems or the specified file systems.  It is  normally  used
       in  the script //eettcc//rrcc during automatic reboot.  Here _f_s_c_k
       reads the table //eettcc//ffssttaabb to determine which file systems
       to  check.   Only  partitions  in  fstab  that are mounted
       ``rw,'' ``rq'' or ``ro'' and that have non-zero pass  num-
       ber are checked.  Filesystems with pass number 1 (normally
       just the root filesystem) are checked one at a time.  When
       pass  1  completes, all remaining filesystems are checked,
       running one process per disk drive.  The disk  drive  con-
       taining  each filesystem is inferred from the longest pre-
       fix of the device name that ends in a digit; the remaining
       characters are assumed to be the partition designator.

       The  system  takes  care  that  only a restricted class of
       innocuous inconsistencies can happen  unless  hardware  or
       software  failures  intervene.   These  are limited to the
       following:

              Unreferenced inodes

              Link counts in inodes too large

              Missing blocks in the free map

              Blocks in the free map also in files

              Counts in the super-block wrong

       These are the only inconsistencies that _f_s_c_k with  the  --pp
       option  will  correct; if it encounters other inconsisten-
       cies, it exits with an abnormal return status and an auto-
       matic reboot will then fail.  For each corrected inconsis-
       tency one or more lines will be  printed  identifying  the
       file  system  on which the correction will take place, and
       the nature of the correction.  After successfully correct-
       ing  a file system, _f_s_c_k will print the number of files on
       that file system, the number of used and free blocks,  and
       the percentage of fragmentation.

       If  sent  a  QUIT signal, _f_s_c_k will finish the file system
       checks, then exit with  an  abnormal  return  status  that
       causes  an  automatic reboot to fail.  This is useful when
       to finish the  file  system  checks  during  an  automatic

       reboot,  but  do not want the machine to come up multiuser
       after the checks complete.

       Without the  --pp  option,  _f_s_c_k  audits  and  interactively
       repairs  inconsistent conditions for file systems.  If the
       file system is inconsistent the operator is  prompted  for
       concurrence  before  each  correction  is  attempted.   It
       should be noted that some of the corrective actions  which
       are  not  correctable  under  the --pp option will result in
       some loss of data.  The amount and severity of  data  lost
       may be determined from the diagnostic output.  The default
       action for each consistency correction is to wait for  the
       operator  to  respond yyeess or nnoo.  If the operator does not
       have write permission on the file system _f_s_c_k will default
       to a --nn action.

       _F_s_c_k  has  more  consistency  checks than its predecessors
       _c_h_e_c_k, _d_c_h_e_c_k, _f_c_h_e_c_k, and _i_c_h_e_c_k combined.

       The following flags are interpreted by _f_s_c_k.

       --bb    Use the block specified immediately after  the  flag
             as the super block for the file system.  Block 32 is
             usually an alternate super block.

       --ll    Limit the number of parallel checks  to  the  number
             specified  in  the  following argument.  By default,
             the limit is the number of disks, running  one  pro-
             cess  per  disk.   If  a smaller limit is given, the
             disks are checked round-robin, one filesystem  at  a
             time.

       --mm    Use  the  mode  specified in octal immediately after
             the flag as the permission bits to use when creating
             the  lost+found  directory  rather  than the default
             1777.  In particular, systems that do  not  wish  to
             have  lost files accessible by all users on the sys-
             tem should use a more restrictive set of permissions
             such as 700.

       --yy    Assume  a  yes  response  to  all questions asked by
             _f_s_c_k; this should be used with great caution as this
             is  a  free  license  to  continue after essentially
             unlimited trouble has been encountered.

       --nn    Assume a no response to all questions asked by  _f_s_c_k
             except  for  ``CONTINUE?'',  which  is assumed to be
             affirmative; do not open the file system  for  writ-
             ing.

       --cc    If the file system is in the old (static table) for-
             mat, convert it to the new (dynamic  table)  format.
             If  the file system is in the new format, convert it
             to the  old  format  provided  the  old  format  can

             support  the  filesystem configuration.  In interac-
             tive mode, _f_s_c_k will list the direction the  conver-
             sion  is  to  be made and ask whether the conversion
             should be done.  If a negative answer is  given,  no
             further  operations  are done on the filesystem.  In
             preen mode,  the  direction  of  the  conversion  is
             listed  and  done  if possible without user interac-
             tion.  Conversion in preen mode is  best  used  when
             all  the  file  systems are being converted at once.
             The format of a file system can be  determined  from
             the first line of output from _d_u_m_p_f_s(8).

       If no filesystems are given to _f_s_c_k then a default list of
       file systems is read from the file //eettcc//ffssttaabb.

       Inconsistencies checked are as follows:

       1.    Blocks claimed by more than one inode  or  the  free
             map.
       2.    Blocks  claimed by an inode outside the range of the
             file system.
       3.    Incorrect link counts.
       4.    Size checks:
                   Directory size not of proper format.
                   Partially truncated file.
       5.    Bad inode format.
       6.    Blocks not accounted for anywhere.
       7.    Directory checks:
                   File pointing to unallocated inode.
                   Inode number out of range.
                   Dot or dot-dot not the first two entries of  a
                   directory or having the wrong inode number.
       8.    Super Block checks:
                   More  blocks  for inodes than there are in the
                   file system.
       9.    Bad free block map format.
       10.   Total free block and/or free inode count  incorrect.

       Orphaned  files  and  directories  (allocated but unrefer-
       enced) are, with the operator's  concurrence,  reconnected
       by  placing  them  in  the lloosstt++ffoouunndd directory.  The name
       assigned is the inode number.  If the _l_o_s_t+_f_o_u_n_d directory
       does  not  exist, it is created.  If there is insufficient
       space its size is increased.

       Because of inconsistencies between the  block  device  and
       the buffer cache, the raw device should always be used.
