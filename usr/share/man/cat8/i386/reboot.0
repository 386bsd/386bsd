     UNIX, an ordinary executable file, is placed into memory by bootstrap at
     location absolute zero, and entered at the executable's entry point
     (_a__e_n_t_r_y). Upon startup, the system reorganizes memory to suit the needs
     of the hardware configuration found, thus it is not designed to be
     restartable without being reloaded on reboot.  Each time it is to be
     bootstrapped, it must be reloaded, usually from a disk file.

     desired, shutdown(8) is normally used.  If there are no users then rreebboooott
     can be used.  Reboot causes the disks to be synced and allows the system
     to perform other shutdown activities such as resynchronizing hardware
     time-of-day clocks.  A multi-user reboot (as described below) is then
     initiated.  This causes a system to be booted and an automatic disk check
     to be performed.  If all this succeeds without incident, the system is
     then brought up for many users.

     Options to reboot are:

     --nn      option avoids the sync.  It can be used if a disk or the
             processor is on fire.

     --qq      reboots quickly and ungracefully, without shutting down running
             processes first.

     RReebboooott normally logs the reboot using syslog(8) and places a shutdown
     record in the login accounting file /_v_a_r/_l_o_g/_w_t_m_p. These actions are
     inhibited if the --nn or --qq options are present.

     power-up or after crashes.  An automatic consistency check of the file
     systems will be performed as described in fsck(8).  and unless this
     fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.

     CCoolldd ssttaarrttss. The 386 PC AT clones attempt to boot the floppy disk drive A
     (otherwise known as drive 0) first, and failing that, attempt to boot the
     hard disk C (otherwise known as hard disk controller 1, drive 0).  The
     automatic boot will attempt to load _v_m_u_n_i_x from partition A of either the
     floppy or the hard disk. This boot may be aborted by typing any character
     on the keyboard repeatedly (four or five times at least) during the
     operating system load phase, after which the bootstrap will prompt for
     the file that you wish to load instead.

     One exception to this is the `d' key, which will not abort the load but
     instead silently force the DEBUG boot flags. The boot flags for an
     autoboot are 0, and 3 for the successive boot after an aborted autoboot
     sequence.  No other provison is made for setting boot flags (yet).  A
     specific device or bootstrap file may be used; for example,

     The file specifications used for the boostrap when loaded with the
     ``askme'' flag (e.g. an aborted autoboot) are of the form:

           device unit partition:

     where _d_e_v_i_c_e is the type of the device, assumed to be on the ISA bus, to
     be searched, _u_n_i_t is the unit number of the disk or tape, and _p_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n
     is the disk partition or tape file number.  Normal line editing
     characters can be used when typing the file specification.  The following
     list of supported devices may vary from installation to installation:

           wd   ST506, IDE, ESDI, RLL disks on a WD100[2367] or lookalike
                controller
           fd   5 1/4" or 3 1/2" High density floppies

     For example, to boot from a file system which starts at cylinder 0 of
     unit 0 of an IDE disk, type ``wd0a:vmunix'' to the boot prompt;
     ``fd0a:vmunix'' would specify a 3 1/2" floppy drive 0 .

     In an emergency, the bootstrap methods described in the paper _I_n_s_t_a_l_l_i_n_g
     _a_n_d _O_p_e_r_a_t_i_n_g _4._3 _B_S_D-_R_e_n_o _U_N_I_X _o_n _t_h_e _A_T/_3_8_6 can be used to boot from a
     distribution tape.

     The disklabel format used by this version of BSD UNIX is quite different
     from that of other architectures.
