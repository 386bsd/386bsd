     The aattrruunn utility runs commands queued by at(1).  It is usually invoked
     by crond(8) every ten minutes.

FFIILLEESS
     /var/at/jobs      Directory containing job files
     /var/at/spool     Directory containing output spool files
     /var/at/lockfile  Job-creation lock file.

BBUUGGSS
     The functionality of aattrruunn should arguaby be merged into crond(8).

CCAAVVEEAATTSS
     Since the default configuration causes aattrruunn to be invoked every ten
     minutes, commands queued by at(1) may end up being executed up to nine
     minutes later than would be otherwise expected.
