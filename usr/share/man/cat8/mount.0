     The mmoouunntt command calls the mount(2) system call to prepare and graft a
     _s_p_e_c_i_a_l device or the remote node (rhost:path) on to the file system tree
     at the point _n_o_d_e. If either _s_p_e_c_i_a_l or _n_o_d_e are not provided, the
     appropriate information is taken from the fstab(5) file.

     The system maintains a list of currently mounted file systems.  If no
     arguments are given to mmoouunntt,, this list is printed.

     Options available for the mmoouunntt command:

     --FF      The standard mount options are parsed and passed to external
             program via the --FF option as a decimal number.  (See example
             below.)

     --ff      Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call;
             if it's not obvious, this ``fakes'' mounting the file system.
             This option is useful in conjunction with the --vv flag to
             determine what the mmoouunntt command is trying to do.

     --oo      Options are specified with a --oo flag followed by a comma
             separated string of options.  The following options apply to any
             file system that is being mounted:

             noexec  Do not allow execution of any binaries on the mounted
                     file system.  This options is useful for a server that
                     has file systems containing binaries for architectures
                     other than its own.

             nosuid  Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
                     bits to take effect.

             nodev   Do not interpret character or block special devices on
                     the file system.  This options is useful for a server
                     that has file systems containing special devices for
                     architectures other than its own.

             synchronous
                     All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously.

     --rr      The file system object is to be mounted read-only.

     --tt _n_f_s | _u_f_s | _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l _t_y_p_e
             The argument following the --tt is used to indicate the file system
             type.  The type _u_f_s is the default.  For example, the mmoouunntt
             command:

                   mount -a -t nonfs,mfs

             mounts all filesystems except those of type NFS and MFS.


             If the type is not one of the internally known types, mount will
             attempt to execute a program in /_u_s_r/_l_i_b_e_x_e_c/_m_o_u_n_t__X_X_X where _X_X_X
             is replaced by the type name.

     --uu      The --uu flag indicates that the status of an already mounted file
             system should be changed.  Any of the options discussed above
             (the --oo option) may be changed; also a file system can be changed
             from read-only to read-write.  The set of options is determined
             by first extracting the options for the file system from the
             fstab table, then applying any options specified by the --oo
             argument, and finally applying the --rr or --ww option.

     --vv      Verbose mode.

     --ww      The file system object is to be read and write.

     --       Any additional options specific to the program can be passed as a
             comma separated list; these options are distinguished by starting
             with a -- (dash).

     Those options that take a value are specified using the syntax
     -option=value.  For example, the mount command:

           mount -t mfs -o nosuid,-N,-s=4000 /dev/dk0b /tmp

     causes mount to attempt to execute:

           /usr/libexec/mount_mfs -F 8 -N -s 4000 /dev/dk0b /tmp

     The following list can be used to override the defaults for an nfs mount:

     hard    I/O system calls will retry until the server responds (default)

     soft    I/O system calls will fail and return errno after _r_e_t_r_a_n_s request
             retransmissions

     spongy  Soft semantics for the stat, lookup, fsstat, readlink and readdir
             filesystem operations and hard semantics for the others.  This
             option is meant to be similar to hard, except that processes will
             not be hung forever when they trip over mount points to dead
             servers.

     bg      If the first mount request times out, do retries in background

     intr    I/O system calls can be interrupted.

     noconn  Do not connect the socket.  Used for UDP servers that send
             replies from a socket other than the nfs server socket.

     tcp     Use TCP transport instead of UDP.

     rsize=#
             Set read size to # bytes.

     wsize=#
             Set write size to # bytes.

     retry=#
             Set mount retry count to #.

     retrans=#
             Set retransmission count for nfs rpc's to #.

     timeo=#
             Set initial nfs timeout to # in 0.1 sec intervals.


     UUmmoouunntt removes the _s_p_e_c_i_a_l device grafted at point _n_o_d_e from file system
     tree.

     Options for the uummoouunntt command:

     --ff      The file system is forcibly unmounted.  Active special devices
             continue to work, but all other files return errors if further
             accesses are attempted.  The root file system cannot be forcibly
             unmounted.

     --aa      All of the file systems described in fstab are unmounted.

     --tt      Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on
             filesystems of the specified type.  More than one type may be
             specified in a comma separated list.  The list of filesystem
             types can be prefixed with ``no'' to specify the filesystem types
             on which no action should be taken.  (See example above for the
             mmoouunntt command.)
