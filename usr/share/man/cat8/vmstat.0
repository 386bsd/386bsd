       _V_m_s_t_a_t   reports  certain  kernel  statistics  kept  about
       process, virtual memory, disk, trap and cpu activity.

       The options are as follows:

       -c     Repeat the display _c_o_u_n_t times.  The first  display
              is  for the time since a reboot and each subsequent
              report is  for  the  time  period  since  the  last
              display.   If  no  _w_a_i_t  interval is specified, the
              default is 1 second.

       -f     Report on the number _f_o_r_k(2)  and  _v_f_o_r_k(2)  system
              calls since system startup, and the number of pages
              of virtual memory involved in each.

       -i     Report on the number of interrupts  taken  by  each
              device since system startup.

       -M     Extract  values  associated with the name list from
              the  specified  core   instead   of   the   default
              ``/dev/kmem''.

       -N     Extract  the  name  list  from the specified system
              instead of the default ``/vmunix''.

       -m     Report on the usage of kernel dynamic memory listed
              first  by  size  of  allocation and then by type of
              usage.

       -s     Display the contents of the _s_u_m  structure,  giving
              the total number of several kinds of paging related
              events which have occurred since system startup.

       -t     Report on the number of page in and  page  reclaims
              since  system  startup,  and  the  amount  of  time
              required by each.

       -w     Pause _w_a_i_t seconds between  each  display.   If  no
              repeat _c_o_u_n_t is specified, the default is infinity.

       By default, _v_m_s_t_a_t displays the following information:


       procs  Information  about  the  numbers  of  processes  in
              various states.

       memory Information  about  the  usage  of virtual and real
              memory.  Virtual pages (reported in units  of  1024
              bytes)  are  considered  active  if  they belong to
              processes which are running or have run in the last
              20 seconds.

              avm  active virtual pages

              These are averaged each five seconds, and given  in
              units per second.

       disks  Disk  operations  per  second (this field is system
              dependent).  Typically paging will be split  across
              the  available  drives.  The header of the field is
              the first character of the disk name and  the  unit
              number.    If   more  than  four  disk  drives  are
              configured in the system, _v_m_s_t_a_t displays only  the
              first  four  drives.   To  force  _v_m_s_t_a_t to display
              specific drives, their names may be supplied on the
              command line.

       faults Trap/interrupt rate averages per second over last 5
              seconds.

              in   device interrupts per interval (including clock interrupts)
              sy   system calls per interval
              cs   cpu context switch rate (switches/interval)

       cpu    Breakdown of percentage usage of CPU time.

              us   user time for normal and low priority processes

              id   cpu idle

       The command ``vmstat -i 5'' will print what the system  is
       doing  every  five  seconds;  this  is  a  good  choice of
       printing interval since this is  how  often  some  of  the
       statistics  are  sampled in the system.  Others vary every
       second and running the output for a  while  will  make  it
