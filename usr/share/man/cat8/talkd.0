     TTaallkkdd is the server that notifies a user that someone else wants to
     initiate a conversation.  It acts a repository of invitations, responding
     to requests by clients wishing to rendezvous to hold a conversation.  In
     normal operation, a client, the caller, initiates a rendezvous by sending
     a CTL_MSG to the server of type LOOK_UP (see <_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s/_t_a_l_k_d._h>). This
     causes the server to search its invitation tables to check if an
     invitation currently exists for the caller (to speak to the callee
     specified in the message).  If the lookup fails, the caller then sends an
     ANNOUNCE message causing the server to broadcast an announcement on the
     callee's login ports requesting contact.  When the callee responds, the
     local server uses the recorded invitation to respond with the appropriate
     rendezvous address and the caller and callee client programs establish a
     stream connection through which the conversation takes place.
