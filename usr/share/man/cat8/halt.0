HALT(8)                 386BSD System Manager's Manual                 HALT(8)

     hhaalltt - stop the processor

     HHaalltt writes out sandbagged information to the disks and then stops the
     processor.  The machine does not reboot, even if the auto-reboot switch
     is set on the console.

     Available options for hhaalltt:

     --nn      No sync before stopping.

     --qq      Quick halt, no graceful shutdown is attempted.

     --yy      This option is needed if you are trying to halt the system from a
             dialup.

     HHaalltt normally logs the shutdown using syslog(8) and places a shutdown
     record in the login accounting file /_v_a_r/_l_o_g/_w_t_m_p. These actions are in-
     hibited if the --nn or --qq options are present.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     reboot(8),  shutdown(8),  syslogd(8)

BBUUGGSS
     It is very difficult to halt a VAX, as the machine wants to then reboot
     itself.  A rather tight loop suffices.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The hhaalltt command appeared in 4.0BSD.
