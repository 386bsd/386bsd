       _e_l_v_i_s_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e preserves your edited text after _e_l_v_i_s dies.
       The  text  can  be  recovered later, via the _e_l_v_i_s_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e
       program.

       For UNIX-like systems, you should never need to  run  this
       program  from  the  command line.  It is run automatically
       when _e_l_v_i_s is about to die, and  it  should  be  run  (via
       /etc/rc) when the computer is booted.  THAT'S ALL!

       For  non-UNIX  systems  such as MS-DOS, you can either use
       _e_l_v_i_s_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e the same way as under UNIX systems (by  run-
       ning  it  from  your AUTOEXEC.BAT file), or you can run it
       separately with the "-R" flag to recover the files in  one
       step.

       If  you're  editing  a file when _e_l_v_i_s dies (due to a bug,
       system crash, power  failure,  etc.)   then  _e_l_v_i_s_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e
       will  preserve  the most recent version of your text.  The
       preserved text is stored in a special directory;  it  does
       NOT overwrite your text file automatically.

       _e_l_v_i_s_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e  will  send  mail  to any user whose work it
       preserves, if  your  operating  system  normally  supports
       mail.

       /tmp/elv*
              The  temporary  file  that  _e_l_v_i_s was using when it
              died.

       /usr/preserve/p*
              The text that is preserved by _e_l_v_i_s_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e.

       /usr/preserve/Index
              A text file which lists the names of all  preserved
              files,  and the names of the /usr/preserve/p* files
              which contain their preserved text.

BBUUGGSS
       Due to the permissions on the /usr/preserve directory,  on
       UNIX systems _e_l_v_i_s_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e must be run as superuser.  This
       is accomplished by making the _e_l_v_i_s_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e executable  be
       owned by "root" and turning on its "set user id" bit.

       If  you're editing a nameless buffer when _e_l_v_i_s dies, then



                                                                1

       _e_l_v_i_s_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e will pretend that the file was named  "foo".
