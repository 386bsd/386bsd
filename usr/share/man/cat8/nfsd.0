     NNffssdd runs on a server machine to service NFS requests from client
     machines.  At least one nnffssdd must be running for a machine to operate as
     a server.  The options --uu and --tt are used to indicate which transport
     protocols are to be served.

     Options available to nnffssdd:

     --rr      Register the NFS service with portmap(8) without creating any
             servers. This option can be used along with the --uu or --tt options
             to re-register NFS if the portmap server is restarted.

     --tt      Serve TCP NFS clients.

     --uu      Serve UDP NFS clients.

     The following arguments to the --uu or --tt options are used to specify
     parameters for service using the respective protocol:

     _m_s_k, _m_t_c_h
             These arguments permit restriction of NFS services to a subset of
             the host addresses. The _m_s_k and _m_t_c_h are applied to the client
             host address as follows:

                   if (( _h_o_s_t__a_d_d_r_e_s_s & _m_s_k ) == _m_t_c_h )
                        - service the client request
                   else
                        - drop the request

     _h_o_s_t_a_d_r_1, ...
             You may also specify zero or more specific host addresses to be
             accepted as well as ones that pass the _m_s_k, _m_t_c_h test above.
             This may only be done for transport protocols that are connection
             based, such as TCP. For the internet domain, _m_s_k, _m_t_c_h and
             _h_o_s_t_a_d_r_s are specified in internet _d_o_t notation.

     _n_u_m_p_r_o_c_s
             Specifies how many servers to fork off. This may only be
             specified for non-connection based protocols such as UDP.

     If neither --uu or --tt are specified, _n_u_m_p_r_o_c_s servers for UDP accepting
     requests from all clients are started.  If _n_u_m_p_r_o_c_s is not specified, it
     defaults to 1.

     For example:

     nfsd -u 255.255.255.0,131.104.48.0,4 -t \
             255.255.0.0,131.104.0.0,131.102.31.2

           Serves UDP and TCP transports. For UDP, it runs 4 daemons that
           accept requests from any client on subnet 131.104.48.  For TCP, it
           accepts connections from any client on network 131.104 plus the
           client with the address 131.102.31.2.

     nfsd -u 255.255.240.0,131.104.0.0,6 -t 0,0


           Serves UDP and TCP transports.  For UDP, it runs 6 daemons that
           accept requests from clients with addresses in the range
           131.104.0.x - 131.104.15.x.  For TCP, it accepts connections from
           any client.

     nfsd -u 0,0,4

           Serves any UDP client with 4 servers, only.

     nfsd 4

           Serves any UDP client with 4 servers, only. (Compatibility)

     A server should typically run enough daemons to handle the maximum level
     of concurrency from its clients, typically four to six.

     NNffssdd listens for service requests at the port indicated in the NFS server
     specification; see _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _F_i_l_e _S_y_s_t_e_m _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l _S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n, RFC1094.

     The client host address restrictions specified here are unrelated to the
