       uucico - UUCP file transfer daemon

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _u_u_c_i_c_o daemon processes file transfer requests queued
       by _u_u_c_p (1) and _u_u_x (1).  It is started when _u_u_c_p  or  _u_u_x
       is  run (unless they are given the --rr option).  It is also
       typically  started  periodically  using  entries  in   the
       _c_r_o_n_t_a_b table(s).

       When  invoked  with the --rr11 option or the --ss or --SS option,
       the daemon will place a call to a remote  system,  running
       in  master mode.  Otherwise the daemon will start in slave
       mode, accepting a call from a remote system.  Typically  a
       special login name will be set up for UUCP which automati-
       cally invokes _u_u_c_i_c_o when a call is made.

       When _u_u_c_i_c_o terminates, it invokes the _u_u_x_q_t  (8)  daemon,
       unless the --qq option is given; _u_u_x_q_t (8) executes any work
       orders created by _u_u_x (1) on a remote system, and any work
       orders  created  locally  which have received remote files
       for which they were waiting.

       If a call fails, _u_u_c_i_c_o will normally refuse to retry  the
       call  until  a  certain  (configurable) amount of time has
       passed.  This may be overriden by the --ff or the --SS option.

       The --ll or --ee option may be used to force _u_u_c_i_c_o to produce
       its own  prompts  of  "login:  "  and  "Password:".   When
       another daemon calls in, it will see these prompts and log
       in as usual; the login name and password will  be  checked
       against  a  separate list kept specially for _u_u_c_i_c_o rather
       than the /_e_t_c/_p_a_s_s_w_d file.  The --ll option will prompt once
       and  then exit.  The --ee option will prompt again after the
       first session is over; in this  mode  _u_u_c_i_c_o  will  perma-
       nently control a port.

       If  _u_u_c_i_c_o  receives a SIGQUIT, SIGTERM or SIGPIPE signal,
       it will cleanly abort  any  current  conversation  with  a
       remote system and exit.  If it receives a SIGHUP signal it
       will abort any current conversation, but will continue  to
       place calls to (if invoked with --rr11)) and accept calls from
       (if invoked with --ee)) other systems.  If it receives a SIG-
       INT  signal  it  will finish the current conversation, but
       will not place or accept any more calls.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The following options may be given to _u_u_c_i_c_o.

       --rr11  Start in master mode (call out to a system);  implied
            by  --ss  or  --SS..  IIff  nnoo ssyysstteemm iiss ssppeecciiffiieedd,, call any

            system for which work is waiting to be done.

       --rr00  Start in slave mode.  This is the default.

       --ss ssyysstteemm
            Call the named system.

       --SS ssyysstteemm
            Call the named system, ignoring any required wait.

       --ff   Ignore any  required  wait  for  any  systems  to  be
            called.

       --ll   Prompt  for  login  name and password using "login: "
            and "Password:".  This allows _u_u_c_i_c_o to be easily run
            from  _i_n_e_t_d  (8).   The  login  name and password are
            checked against the UUCP password file, which has  no
            connection to the file /_e_t_c/_p_a_s_s_w_d.

       --pp ppoorrtt
            Specify  a  port  to call out on or to listen to.  In
            slave mode, this implies --ee..

       --ee   Enter endless  loop  of  login/password  prompts  and
            slave  mode  daemon  execution.  The program will not
            stop by itself; you must use  _k_i_l_l  (1)  to  shut  it
            down.

       --ww   After  calling out (to a particular system when --ss or
            --SS is specifed, or to all  systems  which  have  work
            when  --rr11 is specifed), begin an endless loop as with
            --ee..

       --qq   Do not start the _u_u_x_q_t (8) daemon when finished.

       --DD   Do not detach from the  controlling  terminal.   Nor-
            mally  _u_u_c_i_c_o  detaches from the terminal before each
            call out to another system and before invoking _u_u_x_q_t.
            This option prevents this.

       --xx ttyyppee,, --XX ttyyppee
            Turn  on  particular  debugging types.  The following
            types  are  recognized:  abnormal,  chat,  handshake,
            uucp-proto,  proto,  port, config, spooldir, execute,
            incoming, outgoing.

            Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and
            the  --xx  option  may appear multiple times.  A number
            may also be given, which will turn on that many types
            from the foregoing list; for example, --xx 22 is equiva-
            lent to --xx aabbnnoorrmmaall,,cchhaatt..

            The debugging output is sent to the  debugging  file,
            usually       one      of      /usr/spool/uucp/Debug,

            /usr/spool/uucp/DEBUG,                             or
            /usr/spool/uucp/.Admin/audit.local.

       --II ffiillee
            Set  configuration  file to use.  This option may not
            be available, depending upon how _u_u_c_i_c_o was compiled.

       --uu llooggiinn
            This  option is ignored.  It is only included because
            some versions of uucpd invoke _u_u_c_i_c_o with it.

FFIILLEESS
       The file names may be changed at compilation  time  or  by
       the  configuration file, so these are only approximations.

       /usr/lib/uucp/config - Configuration file.
       /usr/lib/uucp/passwd - Default UUCP password file.
       /usr/spool/uucp - UUCP spool directory.
       /usr/spool/uucp/Log - UUCP log file.
       /usr/spool/uucppublic - Default UUCP public directory.
       /usr/spool/uucp/Debug - Debugging file.
