       _P_w_d__m_k_d_b
       creates
       _d_b(3)
       style secure and insecure databases for the specified file.
       These databases are then installed into ``/etc/spwd.db'' and
       ``/etc/pwd.db'' respectively.
       The file is installed into ``/etc/master.passwd''.
       The file must be in the correct format (see
       _p_a_s_s_w_d(5)).
       It is important to note that the format used in this system is
       different from the historic Version 7 style format.

       The options are as follows:

       -p     Create a Version 7 style password file and install it into ``/etc/password''.

       The two databases differ in that the secure version contains the user's
       encrypted password and the insecure version has an asterisk (``*'')

       The databases are used by the C library password routines (see
       _g_e_t_p_w_e_n_t(3)).

       _P_w_d__m_k_d_b
       exits zero on success, non-zero on failure.

BBUUGGSS
       Because of the necessity for atomic update of the password files,
       _p_w_d__m_k_d_b
       uses
       _r_e_n_a_m_e(2)
       to install them.
       This, however, requires that the file specified on the command line live
       on the same file system as the ``/etc'' directory.

       There are the obvious races with multiple people running
       _p_w_d__m_k_d_b
       on different password files at the same time.

       Previous versions of the system had a program similar to
       _p_w_d__m_k_d_b,
       _m_k_p_a_s_s_w_d(8),
       which built
       _d_b_m (_3)
       style databases for the password file but depended on the calling programs
       to install them.
       The program was renamed in order that previous users of the program
       not be surprised by the changes in functionality.
