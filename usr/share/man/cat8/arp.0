     The aarrpp program displays and modifies the Internet-to-Ethernet address
     translation tables used by the address resolution protocol (arp(4)).
     With no flags, the program displays the current ARP entry for _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e.
     The host may be specified by name or by number, using Internet dot nota-
     tion.

     Available options:

     --aa      The program displays all of the current ARP entries by reading
             the table from the file _k_m_e_m (default /dev/kmem) based on the
             kernel file _v_m_u_n_i_x (default /_v_m_u_n_i_x).

     --dd      A super-user may delete an entry for the host called _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e
             with the --dd flag.

     --ss _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e _e_t_h_e_r__a_d_d_r
             Create an ARP entry for the host called _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e with the Ether-
             net address _e_t_h_e_r__a_d_d_r. The Ethernet address is given as six hex
             bytes separated by colons.  The entry will be permanent unless
             the word _t_e_m_p is given in the command.  If the word _p_u_b is given,
             the entry will be "published"; i.e., this system will act as an
             ARP server, responding to requests for _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e even though the
             host address is not its own.  The word _t_r_a_i_l indicates that
             trailer encapsulations may be sent to this host.

     --ff      Causes the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e to be read and multiple entries to be
             set in the ARP tables.  Entries in the file should be of the form

                   _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e _e_t_h_e_r__a_d_d_r [_t_e_m_p] [_p_u_b] [_t_r_a_i_l]

             with argument meanings as given above.
