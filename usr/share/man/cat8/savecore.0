     SSaavveeccoorree is meant to be called near the end of the initialization file
     /_e_t_c/_r_c (see rc(8)).  Its function is to detect the presence and save the
     state of the operating system's previous abnormal termination, assuming
     the state was recorded for this purpose. If this state information is
     found, ssaavveeccoorree will also write a reboot message in the shutdown log.
     The state information is a snapshot of all RAM memory at the time of
     abnormal termination, untranslated by the processor's memory management
     unit, in physical rather than virtual order (like the memory device, see
     mem(4)).

     Operands supported by ssaavveeccoorree:

     _d_i_r_n_a_m_e       The directory name where the core dump will be written.

     _s_y_s_t_e_m        If the core dump was from a system other than /_3_8_6_b_s_d, the
                   name of that system must be supplied as _s_y_s_t_e_m.

     SSaavveeccoorree looks for a physical RAM memory image of the current system
     (currently recorded during system crashes in the system's swap space) and
     it checks the image for veracity.  If the saved memory image is valid, it
     saves this in _d_i_r_n_a_m_e/_r_a_m._n and the current version of the operating
     system's executable file in _d_i_r_n_a_m_e/_s_y_s_t_e_m._n Sequence numbers are
     incremented and appended to the end of the pathnames each time ssaavveeccoorree
     is run in the directory.

     Before savecore writes out a memory image, it reads a number from the
     file _d_i_r_n_a_m_e/_m_i_n_f_r_e_e. If the number of free kilobytes on the filesystem
     which contains _d_i_r_n_a_m_e is less than the number obtained from the minfree
     file, the core dump is not saved.  If the minfree file does not exist,
     savecore always writes out the core file (assuming that a core dump was
     taken).

     SSaavveeccoorree also logs a reboot message using facility LOG_AUTH (see
     syslog(3))  If the system crashed as a result of a panic, ssaavveeccoorree logs
     the panic string too.

     Can be fooled into thinking a core dump is the wrong size.
