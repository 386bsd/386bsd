     FFiinnggeerrdd is a simple protocol based on _R_F_C_7_4_2 that provides an interface
     to the Name and Finger programs at several network sites.  The program is
     supposed to return a friendly, human-oriented status report on either the
     system at the moment or a particular person in depth.  There is no
     required format and the protocol consists mostly of specifying a single
     ``command line''.

     FFiinnggeerrdd listens for TCP requests at port 79.  Once connected it reads a
     single command line terminated by a <CRLF> which is passed to finger(1).
     FFiinnggeerrdd closes its connections as soon as the output is finished.

     If the line is null (i.e. just a <CRLF> is sent) then finger returns a
     ``default'' report that lists all people logged into the system at that
     moment.

     If a user name is specified (e.g.  eric<CRLF>) then the response lists
     more extended information for only that particular user, whether logged
     in or not.  Allowable ``names'' in the command line include both ``login
     names'' and ``user names''. If a name is ambiguous, all possible
     derivations are returned.

BBUUGGSS
     Connecting directly to the server from a TIP or an equally narrow-minded
     TELNET-protocol user program can result in meaningless attempts at option
     negotiation being sent to the server, which will foul up the command line
     interpretation.  FFiinnggeerrdd should be taught to filter out IAC's and perhaps
     even respond negatively (IAC WON'T) to all option commands received.

     The ffiinnggeerrdd command appeared in 4.3BSD.
