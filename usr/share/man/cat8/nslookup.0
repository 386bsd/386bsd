       nslookup - query Internet name servers interactively

       _N_s_l_o_o_k_u_p  is  a  program  to  query  Internet  domain name
       servers.  Nslookup has two  modes:  interactive  and  non-
       interactive.   Interactive  mode  allows the user to query
       name servers  for  information  about  various  hosts  and
       domains  or  to  print  a list of hosts in a domain.  Non-
       interactive mode is  used  to  print  just  the  name  and
       requested information for a host or domain.


AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS
       Interactive mode is entered in the following cases:

       a)  when  no  arguments are given (the default name server
           will be used),

       b)  when the first argument is a hyphen (-) and the second
           argument  is  the  host  name or Internet address of a
           name server.

       Non-interactive mode is used when  the  name  or  Internet
       address  of the host to be looked up is given as the first
       argument. The optional second argument specifies the  host
       name or address of a name server.

       The  options listed under the ``set'' command below can be
       specified in the  .nslookuprc  file  in  the  user's  home
       directory  if  they  are  listed one per line. Options can
       also be specified on the command line if they precede  the
       arguments  and are prefixed with a hyphen. For example, to
       change the default query type to host information, and the
       initial timeout to 10 seconds, type:
            nslookup -query=hinfo  -timeout=10

       Commands  may  be interrupted at any time by typing a con-
       trol-C.  To exit, type a control-D  (EOF)  or  type  exit.
       The  command line length must be less than 256 characters.
       To treat a built-in command as a  host  name,  precede  it
       with  an  escape character (\).  NN..BB.. an unrecognized com-
       mand will be interpreted as a host name.

              _h_o_s_t is an Internet address and the query type is A
              or  PTR, the name of the host is returned.  If _h_o_s_t
              is a name and does not have a trailing period,  the

              default  domain name is appended to the name. (This
              behavior depends on the state of  the  sseett  options
              ddoommaaiinn, ssrrcchhlliisstt, ddeeffnnaammee, and sseeaarrcchh).  To look up
              a host not in the current domain, append  a  period
              to the name.

       llsseerrvveerr _d_o_m_a_i_n
              Change  the default server to _d_o_m_a_i_n.  LLsseerrvveerr uses
              the initial server to  look  up  information  about
              _d_o_m_a_i_n   while  sseerrvveerr  uses  the  current  default
              server.  If an authoritative answer can't be found,
              the names of servers that might have the answer are
              returned.


       rroooott   Changes the default server to the  server  for  the
              root of the domain name space.  Currently, the host
              ns.nic.ddn.mil is used.  (This command is a synonym
              for  llsseerrvveerr nnss..nniicc..ddddnn..mmiill..)  The name of the root

       If the lookup request was not successful, an error message
       is printed.  Possible errors are:

       Timed out
            The  server did not respond to a request after a cer-
            tain amount of time (changed with sseett  ttiimmeeoouutt==_v_a_l_u_e)
            and  a  certain  number  of retries (changed with sseett
            rreettrryy==_v_a_l_u_e).

       No response from server
            No name server is running on the server machine.

       No records
            The server does not have resource records of the cur-
            rent  query type for the host, although the host name
            is valid.  The query type is specified with  the  sseett
            qquueerryyttyyppee command.

       Non-existent domain
            The host or domain name does not exist.

       Connection refused
       Network is unreachable
            The connection to the name or finger server could not
            be made at the current  time.   This  error  commonly
            occurs with llss and ffiinnggeerr requests.

       Server failure
            The  name  server  found an internal inconsistency in
            its database and could not return a valid answer.

       Refused
            The name server refused to service the request.
