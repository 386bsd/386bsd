     PPaacc reads the printer/plotter accounting files, accumulating the number
     of pages (the usual case) or feet (for raster devices) of paper consumed
     by each user, and printing out how much each user consumed in pages or
     feet and dollars.

     Options and operands available:

     --PP_p_r_i_n_t_e_r  Accounting is done for the named printer.  Normally, account-
                ing is done for the default printer (site dependent) or the
                value of the environment variable PRINTER is used.

     --cc         flag causes the output to be sorted by cost; usually the out-
                put is sorted alphabetically by name.

     --mm         flag causes the host name to be ignored in the accounting
                file.  This allows for a user on multiple machines to have all
                of his printing charges grouped together.

     --pp_p_r_i_c_e    The value _p_r_i_c_e is used for the cost in dollars instead of the
                default value of 0.02 or the price specified in /_e_t_c/_p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p.

     --rr         Reverse the sorting order.

     --ss         Accounting information is summarized on the summary accounting
                file; this summarization is necessary since on a busy system,
                the accounting file can grow by several lines per day.

     _n_a_m_e_s      Statistics are only printed for user(s) _n_a_m_e; usually, statis-
                tics are printed for every user who has used any paper.

FFIILLEESS
     /var/account/?acct  raw accounting files
     /var/account/?_sum  summary accounting files
     /etc/printcap       printer capability data base

     The relationship between the computed price and reality is as yet un-
     known.
