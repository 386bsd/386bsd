     RRoouuttee is a program used to manually manipulate the network routing
     tables.  It normally is not needed, as the system routing table
     management daemon, routed(8),  should tend to this task.

     Options supported by rroouuttee:

     --nn      Prevent attempts to print host and network names symbolically
             when reporting actions.

     --vv      (verbose) Print additional details.

     --qq      Suppress all output.

     Commands accepted by rroouuttee:

     aadddd         Add a route.
     fflluusshh       Remove all routes.
     ddeelleettee      Delete a specific route.
     cchhaannggee      Change aspects of a route (such as its gateway).
     ggeett         Lookup and display the route for a destination.
     mmoonniittoorr     Continuously report any changes to the routing information
                 base, routing lookup misses, or suspected network
                 partionings.

     The monitor command has the syntax

           rroouuttee [--nn] mmoonniittoorr

     The flush command has the syntax

           rroouuttee [--nn] fflluusshh [_f_a_m_i_l_y]

     Where the address family may be specified by any of the --oossii, --xxnnss, or
     --iinneett keywords.

     The other commands have the following syntax:

           rroouuttee [--nn] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [--nneett | --hhoosstt] _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n _g_a_t_e_w_a_y

     where _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is the destination host or network, _g_a_t_e_w_a_y is the
     next-hop gateway to which packets should be addressed.  Routes to a
     particular host are distinguished from those to a network by interpreting
     the Internet address associated with _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n. The optional keywords
     --nneett and --hhoosstt force the destination to be interpreted as a network or a
     host, respectively.  Otherwise, if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n has a ``local address
     part'' of INADDR_ANY , or if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is the symbolic name of a
     network, then the route is assumed to be to a network; otherwise, it is
     presumed to be a route to a host.

     For example, 128.32 is interpreted as --hhoosstt 128.0.0.32; 128.32.130 is
     interpreted as --hhoosstt 128.32.0.130; --nneett 128.32 is interpreted as
     128.32.0.0; and --nneett 128.32.130 is interpreted as 128.32.130.0.

     If the route is via an interface rather than via a gateway, the
     --iinntteerrffaaccee modifier should be specified; the gateway given is the address
     of this host on the common network, indicating the interface to be used
     for transmission.

     The optional modifiers --xxnnss, and --oossii specify that all subsequent
     addresses are in the XNS or OSI address families, and the names must be
     numeric specifications rather than symbolic names.

     The optional --nneettmmaasskk qualifier is intended to achieve the effect of an
     OSI ESIS redirect with the netmask option.  One specifies an additional
     ensuing address parameter (to be interpreted as a network mask).  The
     implicit network mask generated in the inet case can be overridden by
     making sure this option follows the destination parameter.

     The optional modifiers --rrtttt, --rrttttvvaarr, --sseennddppiippee, --rreeccvvppiippee, --mmttuu,
     --hhooppccoouunntt, --eexxppiirree, and --sssstthhrreesshh provide initial values to metrics
     maintained in the routing entry.  These may be individually locked by
     preceding each such modifier to be locked by the --lloocckk meta-modifier, or
     one can specify that all ensuing metrics may be locked by the --lloocckkrreesstt
     meta-modifier.

     In a cchhaannggee or aadddd command where the destination and gateway are not
     sufficient to specify the route (as in the ISO case where several
     interfaces may have the same address), the --iiffpp or --iiffaa modifiers may be
     used to determine the interface or interface address.

     All symbolic names specified for a _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n or _g_a_t_e_w_a_y are looked up
     first as a host name using gethostbyname(3).  If this lookup fails,
     getnetbyname(3) is then used to interpret the name as that of a network.

     RRoouuttee uses a routing socket and the new message types RTM_ADD,
     RTM_DELETE, RTM_GET, and RTM_CHANGE.  As such, only the super-user may
     modify the routing tables.

     If the fflluusshh command is specified, rroouuttee will ``flush'' the routing
     tables of all gateway entries.  One can choose to flush only those routes
     whose destinations are of a given address family, by specifying an
     optional keyword describing which address family.

             The specified route is being added to the tables.  The values
             printed are from the routing table entry supplied in the ioctl(2)
             call.  If the gateway address used was not the primary address of
             the gateway (the first one returned by gethostbyname(3)),  the
             gateway address is printed numerically as well as symbolically.

             As above, but when deleting an entry.

             When the fflluusshh command is specified, each routing table entry
             deleted is indicated with a message of this form.

             An attempt to add a route failed because the gateway listed was
             not on a directly-connected network.  The next-hop gateway must
             be given.

             A delete operation was attempted for an entry which wasn't
             present in the tables.

             An add operation was attempted, but the system was low on
             resources and was unable to allocate memory to create the new
             entry.
