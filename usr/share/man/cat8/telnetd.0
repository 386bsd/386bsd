       _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is a server  which  supports  the  DARPA  standard
       TTEELLNNEETT  virtual  terminal protocol.  _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is invoked by
       the internet server (see _i_n_e_t_d(8)), normally for  requests
       to  connect  to  the  TTEELLNNEETT  port  as  indicated  by  the
       /_e_t_c/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s file (see _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s(5)).  If the  --ddeebbuugg  may
       be  used, to start up tteellnneettdd manually, instead of through
       _i_n_e_t_d(8).  If started up this way, _p_o_r_t may  be  specified
       to run _t_e_l_n_e_t_d on an alternate TCP port number.

       The  --DD  option  may be used for debugging purposes.  This
       allows _t_e_l_n_e_t to print out debugging  information  to  the
       connection,  allowing  the  user  to  see  what telnetd is
       doing.   There  are  several  modifiers:  ooppttiioonnss   prints
       information  about  the  negotiation  of  TTEELLNNEETT  options,
       rreeppoorrtt  prints  the   ooppttiioonnss   information,   plus   some
       additional  information about what processing is going on,
       nneettddaattaa displays the  data  stream  received  by  _t_e_l_n_e_t_d,
       ppttyyddaattaa displays data written to the pty, and eexxeerrcciissee has
       not been implemented yet.

       _T_e_l_n_e_t_d operates by allocating  a  pseudo-terminal  device
       (see  _p_t_y(4))  for a client, then creating a login process
       which has the slave side of the pseudo-terminal as  ssttddiinn,
       ssttddoouutt,  and  ssttddeerrrr.  _T_e_l_n_e_t_d manipulates the master side
       of the pseudo-terminal, implementing the  TTEELLNNEETT  protocol
       and  passing  characters between the remote client and the
       login process.

       When a TTEELLNNEETT session is started up, _t_e_l_n_e_t_d sends  TTEELLNNEETT
       options  to the client side indicating a willingness to do
       _r_e_m_o_t_e _e_c_h_o of characters, to _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s  _g_o  _a_h_e_a_d,  to  do
       _r_e_m_o_t_e   _f_l_o_w   _c_o_n_t_r_o_l,  and  to  receive  _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l  _t_y_p_e
       _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n, _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _s_p_e_e_d _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n, and  _w_i_n_d_o_w  _s_i_z_e
       _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n  from the remote client.  If the remote client
       is willing, the remote terminal type is propagated in  the
       environment  of  the  created  login process.  The pseudo-
       terminal allocated to the client is configured to  operate
       in  cooked  mode,  and  with  XTABS and CRMOD enabled (see
       _t_t_y(4)).

       _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is willing to _d_o: _e_c_h_o, _b_i_n_a_r_y, _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s _g_o _a_h_e_a_d,
       and  _t_i_m_i_n_g  _m_a_r_k.   _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is willing to have the remote
       client  _d_o:  _l_i_n_e_m_o_d_e,  _b_i_n_a_r_y,  _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l  _t_y_p_e,  _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l
       _s_p_e_e_d,  _w_i_n_d_o_w  _s_i_z_e,  _t_o_g_g_l_e _f_l_o_w _c_o_n_t_r_o_l, _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t, _X
       _d_i_s_p_l_a_y _l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n, and _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s _g_o _a_h_e_a_d.

BBUUGGSS
       Some TTEELLNNEETT commands are only partially implemented.

       Because of bugs in the original 4.2 BSD _t_e_l_n_e_t(1), _t_e_l_n_e_t_d
       performs   some  dubious  protocol  exchanges  to  try  to
       discover if the remote client  is,  in  fact,  a  4.2  BSD
       _t_e_l_n_e_t(1).

       _B_i_n_a_r_y  _m_o_d_e  has  no common interpretation except between
       similar operating systems (Unix in this case).

       The terminal type name received from the remote client  is
       converted to lower case.

       _T_e_l_n_e_t_d never sends TTEELLNNEETT _g_o _a_h_e_a_d commands.
