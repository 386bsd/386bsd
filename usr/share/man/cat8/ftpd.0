     FFttppdd is the DARPA Internet File Transfer Protocol server process.  The
     server uses the TCP protocol and listens at the port specified in the
     ``ftp'' service specification; see services(5).

     Available options:

     --dd      Debugging information is written to the syslog.

     --ll      Each ftp(1) session is logged in the syslog.

     --tt      The inactivity timeout period is set to _t_i_m_e_o_u_t seconds (the
             default is 15 minutes).

     --TT      A client may also request a different timeout period; the maximum
             period allowed may be set to _t_i_m_e_o_u_t seconds with the --TT option.
             The default limit is 2 hours.

     The ftp server currently supports the following ftp requests; case is not
     distinguished.

     The remaining ftp requests specified in Internet _R_F_C _9_5_9 are recognized,
     but not implemented.  MDTM and SIZE are not specified in _R_F_C _9_5_9, but
     will appear in the next updated FTP RFC.

     The ftp server will abort an active file transfer only when the ABOR
     command is preceded by a Telnet "Interrupt Process" (IP) signal and a
     Telnet "Synch" signal in the command Telnet stream, as described in
     Internet _R_F_C _9_5_9. If a STAT command is received during a data transfer,
     preceded by a Telnet IP and Synch, transfer status will be returned.

     FFttppdd interprets file names according to the ``globbing'' conventions used
     by csh(1).  This allows users to utilize the metacharacters ``*?[]{}~''.

     FFttppdd authenticates users according to three rules.

           1.   The user name must be in the password data base, /_e_t_c/_p_a_s_s_w_d,
                and not have a null password.  In this case a password must be
                provided by the client before any file operations may be
                performed.

           2.   The user name must not appear in the file /_e_t_c/_f_t_p_u_s_e_r_s.

           3.   The user must have a standard shell returned by
                getusershell(3).

           4.   If the user name is ``anonymous'' or ``ftp'', an anonymous ftp
                account must be present in the password file (user ``ftp'').
                In this case the user is allowed to log in by specifying any
                password (by convention this is given as the client host's
                name).

     In the last case, ffttppdd takes special measures to restrict the client's
     access privileges.  The server performs a chroot(2) command to the home
     directory of the ``ftp'' user.  In order that system security is not
     breached, it is recommended that the ``ftp'' subtree be constructed with
     care;  the following rules are recommended.

           ~_f_t_p      Make the home directory owned by ``ftp'' and unwritable
                     by anyone.

           ~_f_t_p/_b_i_n  Make this directory owned by the super-user and
                     unwritable by anyone.  The program ls(1) must be present
                     to support the list command.  This program should have
                     mode 111.

           ~_f_t_p/_e_t_c  Make this directory owned by the super-user and
                     unwritable by anyone.  The files passwd(5) and group(5)
                     must be present for the ls command to be able to produce
                     owner names rather than numbers.  The password field in
                     passwd is not used, and should not contain real encrypted

                     passwords.  These files should be mode 444.

           ~_f_t_p/_p_u_b  Make this directory mode 777 and owned by ``ftp''. Users
                     should then place files which are to be accessible via
                     the anonymous account in this directory.

     The anonymous account is inherently dangerous and should avoided when
     possible.

     The server must run as the super-user to create sockets with privileged
     port numbers.  It maintains an effective user id of the logged in user,
     reverting to the super-user only when binding addresses to sockets.  The
     possible security holes have been extensively scrutinized, but are
     possibly incomplete.
