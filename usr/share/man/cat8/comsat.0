     CCoommssaatt is the server process which receives reports of incoming mail and
     notifies users if they have requested this service.  CCoommssaatt receives
     messages on a datagram port associated with the ``biff'' service
     specification (see services(5) and inetd(8)).  The one line messages are
     of the form:

           user@mailbox-offset

     If the _u_s_e_r specified is logged in to the system and the associated
     terminal has the owner execute bit turned on (by a ``biff y''), the
     _o_f_f_s_e_t is used as a seek offset into the appropriate mailbox file and the
     first 7 lines or 560 characters of the message are printed on the user's
     terminal.  Lines which appear to be part of the message header other than
     the ``From'', ``To'', ``Date'', or ``Subject'' lines are not included in
     the displayed message.

     The message header filtering is prone to error.  The density of the
     information presented is near the theoretical minimum.

     Users should be notified of mail which arrives on other machines than the
     one to which they are currently logged in.

     The notification should appear in a separate window so it does not mess
     up the screen.

     The ccoommssaatt command appeared in 4.2BSD.
