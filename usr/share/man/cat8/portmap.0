     PPoorrttmmaapp is a server that converts RPC program numbers into DARPA protocol
     port numbers.  It must be running in order to make RPC calls.

     When an RPC server is started, it will tell ppoorrttmmaapp what port number it
     is listening to, and what RPC program numbers it is prepared to serve.
     When a client wishes to make an RPC call to a given program number, it
     will first contact ppoorrttmmaapp on the server machine to determine the port
     number where RPC packets should be sent.

     PPoorrttmmaapp must be started before any RPC servers are invoked.

     Normally ppoorrttmmaapp forks and dissociates itself from the terminal like any
     other daemon.  PPoorrttmmaapp then logs errors using syslog(3).

     Option available:

     --dd      (debug) prevents ppoorrttmmaapp from running as a daemon, and causes
             errors and debugging information to be printed to the standard
             error output.

     If ppoorrttmmaapp crashes, all servers must be restarted.
