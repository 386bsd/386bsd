     The mmkknnoodd command creates device special files.  Normally the shell
     script /_d_e_v/_M_A_K_E_D_E_V is used to create special files for commonly known
     devices; it executes mmkknnoodd with the appropriate arguments and can make
     all the files required for the device.

     To make nodes manually, the four required arguments are:

     _n_a_m_e    Device name, for example ``sd'' for a SCSI disk on an HP300 or a
             ``pty'' for pseudo-devices.

     bb | cc   Type of device. If the device is a block type device such as a
             tape or disk drive which needs both cooked and raw special files,
             the type is bb. All other devices are character type devices, such
             as terminal and psuedo devices, and are type cc.

     _m_a_j_o_r   The major device number is an integer number which tells the ker-
             nel which device driver entry point to use.  To learn what major
             device number to use for a particular device, check the file
             /_d_e_v/_M_A_K_E_D_E_V to see if the device is known, or check the system
             dependent device configuration file:

                   ``/_u_s_r/_s_r_c/_s_y_s/_c_o_n_f/_d_e_v_i_c_e._a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e''

             (for example _d_e_v_i_c_e._h_p_3_0_0).

     _m_i_n_o_r   The minor device number tells the kernel which subunit the node
             corresponds to on the device; for example, a subunit may be a
             filesystem partition or a tty line.
