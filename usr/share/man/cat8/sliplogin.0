DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     SSlliippllooggiinn is used to turn the terminal line on standard input into a
     Serial Line IP (SLIP) link to a remote host.  To do this, the program
     searches the file /_e_t_c/_s_l_i_p._h_o_s_t_s for an entry matching _l_o_g_i_n_n_a_m_e (which
     defaults to the current login name if omitted).  If a matching entry is
     found, the line is configured appropriately for slip (8-bit transparent
     i/o) and converted to SLIP line discipline.  Then a shell script is
     invoked to initialize the slip interface with the appropriate local and
     remote IP address, netmask, etc.

     The usual initialization script is /_e_t_c/_s_l_i_p._l_o_g_i_n but, if particular
     hosts need special initialization, the file /_e_t_c/_s_l_i_p._l_o_g_i_n._l_o_g_i_n_n_a_m_e
     will be executed instead if it exists.  The script is invoked with the
     parameters

     _s_l_i_p_u_n_i_t  The unit number of the slip interface assigned to this line.
               E.g., 00 for ssll00.

     _s_p_e_e_d     The speed of the line.

     _a_r_g_s      The arguments from the /_e_t_c/_s_l_i_p._h_o_s_t_s entry, in order starting
               with _l_o_g_i_n_n_a_m_e.

     Only the super-user may attach a network interface.  The interface is
     automatically detached when the other end hangs up or the sslliippllooggiinn
     process dies.  If the kernel slip module has been configured for it, all
     routes through that interface will also disappear at the same time.  If
     there is other processing a site would like done on hangup, the file
     /_e_t_c/_s_l_i_p._l_o_g_o_u_t or /_e_t_c/_s_l_i_p._l_o_g_o_u_t._l_o_g_i_n_n_a_m_e is executed if it exists.
     It is given the same arguments as the login script.

   FFoorrmmaatt ooff //eettcc//sslliipp..hhoossttss
     Comments (lines starting with a `#') and blank lines are ignored.  Other
     lines must start with a _l_o_g_i_n_n_a_m_e but the remaining arguments can be
     whatever is appropriate for the _s_l_i_p._l_o_g_i_n file that will be executed for
     that name.  Arguments are separated by white space and follow normal
     sh(1) quoting conventions (however, _l_o_g_i_n_n_a_m_e cannot be quoted).
     Usually, lines have the form

           loginname local-address remote-address netmask opt-args

     where _l_o_c_a_l-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s and _r_e_m_o_t_e-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s are the IP host names or addresses
     of the local and remote ends of the slip line and _n_e_t_m_a_s_k is the
     appropriate IP netmask.  These arguments are passed directly to
     ifconfig(8).  _O_p_t-_a_r_g_s are optional arguments used to configure the line.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
     The normal use of sslliippllooggiinn is to create a /_e_t_c/_p_a_s_s_w_d entry for each
     legal, remote slip site with sslliippllooggiinn as the shell for that entry.
     E.g.,

     Sfoo:ikhuy6:2010:1:slip line to foo:/tmp:/etc/sliplogin

     (Our convention is to name the account used by remote host _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e as
     _S_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e.) Then an entry is added to _s_l_i_p._h_o_s_t_s that looks like:


           Sfoo    `hostname`      foo     netmask

     where `_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e` will be evaluated by sh to the local host name and
     _n_e_t_m_a_s_k is the local host IP netmask.

     Note that sslliippllooggiinn must be setuid to root and, while not a security
     hole, moral defectives can use it to place terminal lines in an unusable
     state and/or deny access to legitimate users of a remote slip line.  To
     prevent this, a site can create a group, say _s_l_i_p, that only the slip
     login accounts are put in then make sure that /_e_t_c/_s_l_i_p_l_o_g_i_n is in group
     _s_l_i_p and mode 4550 (setuid root, only group _s_l_i_p can execute binary).

     SSlliippllooggiinn logs various information to the system log daemon, syslogd(8),
     with a facility code of _d_a_e_m_o_n. The messages are listed here, grouped by
     severity level.
