     UDP is a simple, unreliable datagram protocol which is used to support
     the SOCK_DGRAM abstraction for the Internet protocol family.  UDP sockets
     are connectionless, and are normally used with the sendto and recvfrom
     calls, though the connect(2) call may also be used to fix the destination
     for future packets (in which case the recv(2) or read(2) and send(2) or
     write(2) system calls may be used).

     UDP address formats are identical to those used by TCP. In particular UDP
     provides a port identifier in addition to the normal Internet address
     format.  Note that the UDP port space is separate from the TCP port space
     (i.e. a UDP port may not be ``connected'' to a TCP port).  In addition
     broadcast packets may be sent (assuming the underlying network supports
     this) by using a reserved ``broadcast address''; this address is network
     interface dependent.

     Options at the IP transport level may be used with UDP; see ip(4).

     A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors returned:

     [EISCONN]        when trying to establish a connection on a socket which
                      already has one, or when trying to send a datagram with
                      the destination address specified and the socket is al-
                      ready connected;

     [ENOTCONN]       when trying to send a datagram, but no destination ad-
                      dress is specified, and the socket hasn't been connect-
                      ed;

     [ENOBUFS]        when the system runs out of memory for an internal data
                      structure;

     [EADDRINUSE]     when an attempt is made to create a socket with a port
                      which has already been allocated;

     [EADDRNOTAVAIL]  when an attempt is made to create a socket with a net-
                      work address for which no network interface exists.
