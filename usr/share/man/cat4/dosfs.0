     The dosfs(4) filesystem provides support for a MS DOS formatted hard disk
     partition or floppy disk to be mounted on the system's filesystem tree,
     allowing DOS files to be directly accessible by all user programs.

     Since DOS file and directory names and attributes do not correspond to
     POSIX names and attributes, the filesystem implementation partially
     compensates for these limitations for the convienence of the user. File
     and directory names are silently truncated and case-wrapped to 7
     character lowercase characters and numbers (11 if the 8th is a period).
     While the names are recorded internally as upper case only, case is
     always mapped to lower case on filename lookup and creation. Filenames
     ending in a period have the period silently dropped as well. Files can
     only be made "system read only" regardless of user, as only the single
     write bit per file is present (the hidden and archived attribute bits are
     not implemented). While all files appear to be owned by root, any user
     can alter contents and attributes at will (so the only protection present
     is that of the mount directory itself).  Read and execute attribute bits
     are always set for user, group, and other.  The write protect attribute
     bit can only be set from the user set (where it will appear to set them
     all).

     In addition, all time attributes reported are always the time of last
     modification. Since times are kept in local time, times fitfully
     correspond to DOS interpretations.
