     ffdd, ssttddiinn, ssttddoouutt, ssttddeerrrr - file descriptor files

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The files /_d_e_v/_f_d/_0 through /_d_e_v/_f_d/# refer to file descriptors which can
     be accessed through the file system.  If the file descriptor is open and
     the mode the file is being opened with is a subset of the mode of the ex-
     isting descriptor, the call:

           fd = open("/dev/fd/0", mode);

     and the call:

           fd = fcntl(0, F_DUPFD, 0);

     are equivalent.

     Opening the files /_d_e_v/_s_t_d_i_n, /_d_e_v/_s_t_d_o_u_t and /_d_e_v/_s_t_d_e_r_r is equivalent
     to the following calls:

           fd = fcntl(STDIN_FILENO,  F_DUPFD, 0);
           fd = fcntl(STDOUT_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);
           fd = fcntl(STDERR_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);

     Flags to the open(2) call other than O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY and O_RDWR are
     ignored.
