     The bbsseeaarrcchh() function searches an array of _n_m_e_m_b objects, the inital
     member of which is pointed to by _b_a_s_e, for a member that matches the ob-
     ject pointed to by _k_e_y. The size of each member of the array is specified
     by _s_i_z_e.

     The contents of the array should be in ascending sorted order according
     to the comparison function referenced by _c_o_m_p_a_r. The _c_o_m_p_a_r routine is
     expected to have two two arguments which point to the _k_e_y object and to
     an array member, in that order, and should return an integer less than,
     equal to, or greater than zero if the _k_e_y object is found, respectively,
     to be less than, to match, or be greater than the array member.

     The bbsseeaarrcchh() function returns a pointer to a matching member of the ar-
     ray, or a null pointer if no match is found.  If two members compare as
     equal, which member is matched is unspecified.

     The bbsseeaarrcchh() function conforms to ANSI C3.159-1989 (``ANSI C'').
