     The three types of buffering available are unbuffered, block buffered,
     and line buffered.  When an output stream is unbuffered, information ap-
     pears on the destination file or terminal as soon as written; when it is
     block buffered many characters are saved up and written as a block; when
     it is line buffered characters are saved up until a newline is output or
     input is read from any stream attached to a terminal device (typically
     stdin).  The function fflush(3) may be used to force the block out early.
     (See fclose(3).)  Normally all files are block buffered.  When the first
     I/O operation occurs on a file, malloc(3) is called, and a buffer is ob-
     tained.  If a stream refers to a terminal (as _s_t_d_o_u_t normally does) it is
     line buffered.  The standard error stream _s_t_d_e_r_r is always unbuffered.

     The sseettvvbbuuff() function may be used at any time on any open stream to
     change its buffer.  The _m_o_d_e parameter must be one of the following three
     macros:

           _IONBF  unbuffered

           _IOLBF  line buffered

           _IOFBF  fully buffered

     Except for unbuffered files, the _b_u_f argument should point to a buffer at
     least _s_i_z_e bytes long; this buffer will be used instead of the current
     buffer.  If the argument _b_u_f is NULL, only the mode is affected; a new
     buffer will be allocated on the next read or write operation.  The
     sseettvvbbuuff() function may be used at any time, but can only change the mode
     of a stream when it is not ``active'': that is, before any I/O, or imme-
     diately after a call to fflush.

     The other three calls are, in effect, simply aliases for calls to
     sseettvvbbuuff().  The sseettbbuuff() function is exactly equivalent to the call

           setvbuf(stream, buf, buf ? _IOFBF: _IONBF, BUFSIZ);

     The sseettbbuuffffeerr() function is the same, except that the size of the buffer
     is up to the caller, rather than being determined by the default BUFSIZ.
     The sseettlliinneebbuuff() function is exactly equivalent to the call:

           setvbuf(stream, (char *)NULL, _IOLBF, 0);

     The sseettbbuuff() and sseettvvbbuuff() functions conform to ANSI C3.159-1989 (``ANSI
     C'').

BBUUGGSS
     The sseettbbuuffffeerr() and sseettlliinneebbuuff() functions are not portable to versions
     of BSD UNIX before 4.2BSD. On 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD systems, sseettbbuuff() always
     uses a suboptimal buffer size and should be avoided.
