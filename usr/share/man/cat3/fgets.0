     The ffggeettss() function reads at most one less than the number of characters
     specified by size from the given _s_t_r_e_a_m and stores them in the string
     _s_t_r. Reading stops when a newline character is found, at end-of-file or
     error.  The newline, if any, is retained.  In any case a `\0' character
     is appended to end the string.

     The ggeettss() function is equivalent to ffggeettss() with an infinite size and a
     _s_t_r_e_a_m of _s_t_d_i_n, except that the newline character (if any) is not stored
     in the string.  It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the
     input line, if any, is sufficiently short to fit in the string.

     Upon successful completion, ffggeettss() and ggeettss() return a pointer to the
     string.  If end-of-file or an error occurs before any characters are
     read, they return NULL. The ffggeettss() and functions ggeettss() do not
     distinguish between end-of-file and error, and callers must use feof(3)
     and ferror(3) to determine which occurred.

EERRRROORRSS
     [EBADF]  The given _s_t_r_e_a_m is not a readable stream.

     The function ffggeettss() may also fail and set _e_r_r_n_o for any of the errors
     specified for the routines fflush(3),  fstat(2),  read(2),  or malloc(3).


     The function ggeettss() may also fail and set _e_r_r_n_o for any of the errors
     specified for the routine getchar(3).

     The functions ffggeettss() and ggeettss() conform to ANSI C3.159-1989 (``ANSI
     C'').

BBUUGGSS
     Since it is usually impossible to ensure that the next input line is less
     than some arbitrary length, and because overflowing the input buffer is
     almost invariably a security violation, programs should _N_E_V_E_R use ggeettss().
     The ggeettss() function exists purely to conform to ANSI C3.159-1989 (``ANSI
     C'').
