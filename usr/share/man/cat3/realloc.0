     The rreeaalllloocc() function changes the size of the object pointed to by _p_t_r
     to the size specified by _s_i_z_e. The contents of the object are unchanged
     up to the lesser of the new and old sizes.  If the new size is larger,
     the value of the newly allocated portion of the object is indeterminate.
     If _p_t_r is a null pointer, the rreeaalllloocc() function behaves like the mal-
     loc(3) function for the specified size.  Otherwise, if _p_t_r does not match
     a pointer earlier returned by the calloc(3),  malloc(3),  or rreeaalllloocc()
     function, or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or
     rreeaalllloocc() function, unpredictable and usually detrimental behaviour will
     occur.  If the space cannot be allocated, the object pointed to by _p_t_r is
     unchanged.  If _s_i_z_e is zero and _p_t_r is not a null pointer, the object it
     points to is freed.

     The rreeaalllloocc() function returns either a null pointer or a pointer to the
     possibly moved allocated space.
