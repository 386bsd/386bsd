     The uuttiimmee() function sets the access and modification times of the named
     file.

     If _t_i_m_e_p is NULL, the access and modification times are set to the
     current time.  The calling process must be the owner of the file or have
     permission to write the file.

     If _t_i_m_e_p is non-NULL, _t_i_m_e is assumed to be a pointer to a utimbuf
     structure, as defined in <_u_t_i_m_e._h>:

           struct utimbuf {
                   time_t actime;          /* Access time */
                   time_t modtime;         /* Modification time */
           } ;

     The access time is set to the value of the actime member, and the
     modification time is set to the value of the modtime member.  The times
     are measured in seconds since 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, January 1,
     1970, Coordinated Universal Time.  The calling process must be the owner
     of the file or be the super-user.

     In either case, the inode-change-time of the file is set to the current
     time.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

EERRRROORRSS
     UUttiimmee() will fail if:

     [EACCES]      Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                   prefix; or the _t_i_m_e_s argument is NULL and the effective
                   user ID of the process does not match the owner of the
                   file, and is not the super-user, and write access is
                   denied.

     [EFAULT]      File or _t_i_m_e_s points outside the process's allocated
                   address space.

     [EINVAL]      The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                   set.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while reading or writing the affected
                   inode.

     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an


                   entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]      The named file does not exist.

     [ENOTDIR]     A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EPERM]       The _t_i_m_e_s argument is not NULL and the calling process's
                   effective user ID does not match the owner of the file and
                   is not the super-user.

     [EROFS]       The file system containing the file is mounted read-only.
