DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ffuunnooppeenn() function associates a stream with up to four ``I/O
     functions''. Either _r_e_a_d_f_n or _w_r_i_t_e_f_n must be specified; the others can
     be given as an appropriately-typed NULL pointer.  These I/O functions
     will be used to read, write, seek and close the new stream.

     In general, omitting a function means that any attempt to perform the as-
     sociated operation on the resulting stream will fail.  If the close func-
     tion is omitted, closing the stream will flush any buffered output and
     then succeed.

     The calling conventions of _r_e_a_d_f_n, _w_r_i_t_e_f_n, _s_e_e_k_f_n and _c_l_o_s_e_f_n must match
     those, respectively, of read(2),  write(2),  seek(2),  and close(2) with
     the single exception that they are passed the _c_o_o_k_i_e argument specified
     to ffuunnooppeenn() in place of the traditional file descriptor argument.

     Read and write I/O functions are allowed to change the underlying buffer
     on fully buffered or line buffered streams by calling setvbuf(3).  They
     are also not required to completely fill or empty the buffer.  They are
     not, however, allowed to change streams from unbuffered to buffered or to
     change the state of the line buffering flag.  They must also be prepared
     to have read or write calls occur on buffers other than the one most re-
     cently specified.

     All user I/O functions can report an error by returning -1.  Additional-
     ly, all of the functions should set the external variable _e_r_r_n_o appropri-
     ately if an error occurs.

     An error on cclloosseeffnn() does not keep the stream open.

     As a convenience, the include file <_s_t_d_i_o._h> defines the macros ffrrooppeenn()
     and ffwwooppeenn() as calls to ffuunnooppeenn() with only a read or write function
     specified.

     Upon successful completion, ffuunnooppeenn() returns a FILE pointer.  Otherwise,
     NULL is returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the er-
     ror.

EERRRROORRSS
     [EINVAL]  The ffuunnooppeenn() function was called without either a read or
               write function.  The ffuunnooppeenn() function may also fail and set
               _e_r_r_n_o for any of the errors specified for the routine
               malloc(3).

     These functions are currently under development.

BBUUGGSS
     The ffuunnooppeenn() function may not be portable to systems other than BSD
     UNIX.
