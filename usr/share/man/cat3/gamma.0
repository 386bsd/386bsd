     Lgamma returns ln|gamma(x)|.

     The external integer _s_i_g_n_g_a_m returns the sign of gamma(x) .

     Do _n_o_t use the expression ``signgam*exp(lgamma(x))'' to compute g :=
     gamma(x).  Instead use a program like this (in C):

     lg = lgamma(x); g = signgam*exp(lg);

     Only after llggaammmmaa() has returned can signgam be correct.  Note too that
     gamma(x) must overflow when x is large enough, underflow when -x is large
     enough, and spawn a division by zero when x is a nonpositive integer.

     Only in the UNIX math library for C was the name gamma ever attached to
     lngamma.  Elsewhere, for instance in IBM's FORTRAN library, the name
     GAMMA belongs to gamma and the name ALGAMA to lngamma in single
     precision; in double the names are DGAMMA and DLGAMA. Why should C be
     different?

     Archaeological records suggest that C's _g_a_m_m_a originally delivered
     ln(gamma(|x|)).  Later, the program gamma was changed to cope with
     negative arguments x in a more conventional way, but the documentation
     did not reflect that change correctly.  The most recent change corrects
     inaccurate values when x is almost a negative integer, and lets gamma(x)
     be computed without conditional expressions.  Programmers should not
     assume that llggaammmmaa() has settled down.

     At some time in the future, the name _g_a_m_m_a will be rehabilitated and used
     for the gamma function, just as is done in FORTRAN. The reason for this
     is not so much compatibility with FORTRAN as a desire to achieve greater
     speed for smaller values of |x| and greater accuracy for larger values.

     Meanwhile, programmers who have to use the name _g_a_m_m_a in its former
     sense, for what is now llggaammmmaa(), have two choices:

     1.      Use the old math library, _l_i_b_o_m.

     2.      Add the following program to your others:

             #include <math.h>
             double gamma(x)
             double x;
             {
                     return (lgamma(x));
             }

     The reserved operand is returned on a VAX for negative integer arguments,
     _e_r_r_n_o is set to ERANGE; for very large arguments over/underflows will
     occur inside the llggaammmmaa() routine.
