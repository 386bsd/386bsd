DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ssttrrmmooddee() function converts a file _m_o_d_e (the type and permission
     information associated with an inode, see stat(2))  into a symbolic
     string which is stored in the location referenced by _b_p. This stored
     string is eleven characters in length plus a trailing NULL.

     The first character is the inode type, and will be one of the following:

           -     regular file
           b     block special
           c     character special
           d     directory
           l     symbolic link
           p     fifo
           s     socket
           ?     unknown inode type

     The next nine characters encode three sets of permissions, in three
     characters each.  The first three characters are the permissions for the
     owner of the file, the second three for the group the file belongs to,
     and the third for the ``other'', or default, set of users.

     Permission checking is done as specifically as possible.  If read
     permission is denied to the owner of a file in the first set of
     permssions, the owner of the file will not be able to read the file.
     This is true even if the owner is in the file's group and the group
     permissions allow reading or the ``other'' permissions allow reading.

     If the first character of the three character set is an ``r'', the file
     is readable for that set of users; if a dash ``-'', it is not readable.

     If the second character of the three character set is a ``w'', the file
     is writable for that set of users; if a dash ``-'', it is not writable.

     The third character is the first of the following characters that apply:

     S     If the character is part of the owner permissions and the file is
           not executable or the directory is not searchable, by the owner,
           and the set-user-id bit is set.

     S     If the character is part of the group permissions and the file is
           not executable or the directory is not searchable, by the group,
           and the set-group-id bit is set.

     T     If the character is part of the other permissions and the file is
           not executable or the directory is not searchable, by others, and
           the ``sticky'' (S_ISVTX) bit is set.

     s     If the character is part of the owner permissions and the file is
           executable or the directory searchable, by the owner, and the set-
           user-id bit is set.

     s     If the character is part of the group permissions and the file is
           executable or the directory searchable, by the group, and the set-

           group-id bit is set.

     t     If the character is part of the other permissions and the file is
           executable or the directory searchable, by others, and the
           ``sticky'' (S_ISVTX) bit is set.

     x     The file is executable or the directory is searchable.

     -     None of the above apply.

     The last character is a plus sign ``+'' if any there are any alternate or
     additional access control methods associated with the inode, otherwise it
     will be a space.
