     The ggeettllooaaddaavvgg() function returns the number of processes in the system
     run queue averaged over various periods of time.  Up to _n_e_l_e_m samples are
     retrieved and assigned to successive elements of _l_o_a_d_a_v_g[]. The system
     imposes a maximum of 3 samples, representing averages over the last 1, 5,
     and 15 minutes, respectively.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     If the load average was unobtainable, -1 is returned; otherwise, the
     number of samples actually retrieved is returned.

     The ggeettllooaaddaavvgg() function is currently under development.

     Programs using this utility must have read permission on /_d_e_v/_k_m_e_m. This
     restriction will eventually be lifted.
