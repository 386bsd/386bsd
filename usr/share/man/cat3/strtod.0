     The ssttrrttoodd() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed
     to by _n_p_t_r to _d_o_u_b_l_e representation.

     The expected form of the string is an optional plus (``+'') or minus sign
     (``-'') followed by a sequence of digits optionally containing a decimal-
     point character, optionally followed by an exponent.  An exponent con-
     sists of an ``E'' or ``e'', followed by an optional plus or minus sign,
     followed by a sequence of digits.

     Leading white-space characters in the string (as defined by the iss-
     pace(3) function) are skipped.

     The ssttrrttoodd() function returns the converted value, if any.

     If _e_n_d_p_t_r is not NULL, a pointer to the character after the last charac-
     ter used in the conversion is stored in the location referenced by
     _e_n_d_p_t_r.

     If no conversion is performed, zero is returned and the value of _n_p_t_r is
     stored in the location referenced by _e_n_d_p_t_r.

     If the correct value would cause overflow, plus or minus HUGE_VAL is re-
     turned (according to the sign of the value), and ERANGE is stored in
     _e_r_r_n_o. If the correct value would cause underflow, zero is returned and
     ERANGE is stored in _e_r_r_n_o.
