     The real and effective user ID's of the current process are set according
     to the arguments.  If _r_u_i_d or _e_u_i_d is -1, the current uid is filled in by
     the system.  Unprivileged users may change the real user ID to the
     effective user ID and vice-versa; only the super-user may make other
     changes.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     [EPERM]  The current process is not the super-user and a change other
