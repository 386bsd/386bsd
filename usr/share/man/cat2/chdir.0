     The _p_a_t_h arument points to the pathname of a directory.  The cchhddiirr()
     function causes the named directory to become the current working
     directory, that is, the starting point for path searches of pathnames not
     beginning with a slash, `/'.

     The ffcchhddiirr() function causes the directory referenced by _f_d to become the
     current working directory, the starting point for path searches of
     pathnames not beginning with a slash, `/'.

     In order for a directory to become the current directory, a process must
     have execute (search) access to the directory.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     CChhddiirr() will fail and the current working directory will be unchanged if
     one or more of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]     A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]      The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                   set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                   entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]      The named directory does not exist.

     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.

     [EACCES]      Search permission is denied for any component of the path
                   name.

     [EFAULT]      _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                   file system.

     FFcchhddiirr() will fail and the current working directory will be unchanged if
     one or more of the following are true:

     [EACCES]      Search permission is denied for the directory referenced by
                   the file descriptor.



     [ENOTDIR]     The file descriptor does not reference a directory.

     [EBADF]       The argument _f_d is not a valid file descriptor.

     CChhddiirr() is expected to conform to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (``POSIX'').
