     The uummaasskk() routine sets the process's file mode creation mask to _n_u_m_a_s_k
     and returns the previous value of the mask.  The 9 low-order access per-
     mission bits of _n_u_m_a_s_k are used by system calls, including open(2),
     mkdir(2),  and mkfifo(2),  to turn off corresponding bits requested in
     file mode.  (see chmod(2)).  This clearing allows each user to restrict
     the default access to his files.

     The default mask value is 022 (write access for owner only).  Child pro-
     cesses inherit the mask of the calling process.

     The uummaasskk() function call is expected to conform to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988
     (``POSIX'').
