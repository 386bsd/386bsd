     aacccceessss - check access permissions of a file or pathname

     aacccceessss(_c_o_n_s_t _c_h_a_r *_p_a_t_h, _i_n_t _m_o_d_e)

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The aacccceessss() function checks the accessibility of the file named by _p_a_t_h
     for the access permissions indicated by _m_o_d_e. The value of _m_o_d_e is the
     bitwise inclusive OR of the access permissions to be checked (R_OK for
     read permission, W_OK for write permission and X_OK for execute/search
     permission) or the existence test, F_OK. All components of the pathname
     _p_a_t_h are checked for access permissions (including F_OK).

     The real user ID is used in place of the effective user ID and the real
     group access list (including the real group ID) are used in place of the
     effective ID for verifying permission.

     Even if a process has appropriate privileges and indicates success for
     X_OK, the file may not actually have execute permission bits set.
     Likewise for R_OK and W_OK.

     If _p_a_t_h cannot be found or if any of the desired access modes would not
     be granted, then a -1 value is returned; otherwise a 0 value is returned.

EERRRROORRSS
     Access to the file is denied if:

     [ENOTDIR]     A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]      The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                   set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                   entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]      The named file does not exist.

     [EACCES]      Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                   prefix.

     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.

     [EROFS]       Write access is requested for a file on a read-only file
                   system.

     [ETXTBSY]     Write access is requested for a pure procedure (shared
                   text) file presently being executed.

     [EACCES]      Permission bits of the file mode do not permit the
                   requested access, or search permission is denied on a
                   component of the path prefix.  The owner of a file has
                   permission checked with respect to the ``owner'' read,
                   write, and execute mode bits, members of the file's group
                   other than the owner have permission checked with respect
                   to the ``group'' mode bits, and all others have permissions

                   checked with respect to the ``other'' mode bits.

     [EFAULT]      _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                   file system.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     AAcccceessss() conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (``POSIX'').

CCAAVVEEAATT
     AAcccceessss() is a potential security hole and should never be used.
