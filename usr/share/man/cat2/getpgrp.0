     The process group of the specified process is returned by ggeettppggrrpp().  If
     _p_i_d is zero, the call applies to the current process.

     Process groups are used for distribution of signals, and by terminals to
     arbitrate requests for their input: processes that have the same process
     group as the terminal are foreground and may read, while others will
     block with a signal if they attempt to read.

     This call is thus used by programs such as csh(1) to create process
     groups in implementing job control.  The TIOCGPGRP and TIOCSPGRP calls
     described in termios(4) are used to get/set the process group of the
     control terminal.
