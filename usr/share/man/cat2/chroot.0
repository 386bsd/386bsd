     _D_i_r_n_a_m_e is the address of the pathname of a directory, terminated by an
     ASCII NUL.  CChhrroooott() causes _d_i_r_n_a_m_e to become the root directory, that
     is, the starting point for path searches of pathnames beginning with `/'.

     In order for a directory to become the root directory a process must have
     execute (search) access for that directory.

     It should be noted that cchhrroooott() has no effect on the process's current
     directory.

     This call is restricted to the super-user.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate an error.

     CChhrroooott() will fail and the root directory will be unchanged if:

     [ENOTDIR]  A component of the path name is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]   The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an en-
                tire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]   The named directory does not exist.

     [EACCES]   Search permission is denied for any component of the path
                name.

     [ELOOP]    Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                pathname.

     [EFAULT]   _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EIO]      An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                file system.
