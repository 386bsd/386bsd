EERRRROORRSS
     The named file is removed unless:

     [ENOTDIR]       A component of the path is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]        The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                     set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]  A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                     entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]        The named directory does not exist.

     [ELOOP]         Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
                     the pathname.

     [ENOTEMPTY]     The named directory contains files other than `.' and
                     `..' in it.

     [EACCES]        Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                     prefix.

     [EACCES]        Write permission is denied on the directory containing
                     the link to be removed.

     [EPERM]         The directory containing the directory to be removed is
                     marked sticky, and neither the containing directory nor
                     the directory to be removed are owned by the effective
                     user ID.

     [EBUSY]         The directory to be removed is the mount point for a
                     mounted file system.

     [EIO]           An I/O error occurred while deleting the directory entry
                     or deallocating the inode.

     [EROFS]         The directory entry to be removed resides on a read-only
                     file system.

     [EFAULT]        _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address
                     space.
