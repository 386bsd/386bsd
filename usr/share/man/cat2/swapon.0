     SSwwaappoonn() makes the block device _s_p_e_c_i_a_l available to the system for
     allocation for paging and swapping.  The names of potentially available
     devices are known to the system and defined at system configuration time.
     The size of the swap area on _s_p_e_c_i_a_l is calculated at the time the device
     is first made available for swapping.

     If an error has occurred, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to
     indicate the error.

EERRRROORRSS
     SSwwaappoonn() succeeds unless:

     [ENOTDIR]     A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]      The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                   set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                   entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]      The named device does not exist.

     [EACCES]      Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                   prefix.

     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.

     [EPERM]       The caller is not the super-user.

     [ENOTBLK]     _S_p_e_c_i_a_l is not a block device.

     [EBUSY]       The device specified by _s_p_e_c_i_a_l has already been made
                   available for swapping

     [EINVAL]      The device configured by _s_p_e_c_i_a_l was not configured into
                   the system as a swap device.

     [ENXIO]       The major device number of _s_p_e_c_i_a_l is out of range (this
                   indicates no device driver exists for the associated
                   hardware).

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while opening the swap device.

     [EFAULT]      _S_p_e_c_i_a_l points outside the process's allocated address
                   space.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     swapon(8),  config(8)

BBUUGGSS
     There is no way to stop swapping on a disk so that the pack may be
     dismounted.

     This call will be upgraded in future versions of the system.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The sswwaappoonn function call appeared in 4.0BSD.
