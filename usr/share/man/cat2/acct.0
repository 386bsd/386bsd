DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The aacccctt() call enables or disables the collection of system accounting
     records.  If the argument _f_i_l_e is a nil pointer, accounting is disabled.
     If _f_i_l_e is an _e_x_i_s_t_i_n_g pathname (null-terminated), record collection is
     enabled and for every process initiated which terminates under normal
     conditions an accounting record is appended to _f_i_l_e. Abnormal conditions
     of termination are reboots or other fatal system problems.  Records for
     processes which never terminate can not be produced by aacccctt().

     For more information on the record structure used by aacccctt(), see
     /_u_s_r/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e/_s_y_s/_a_c_c_t._h and acct(5).

     This call is permitted only to the super-user.

NNOOTTEESS
     Accounting is automatically disabled when the file system the accounting
     file resides on runs out of space; it is enabled when space once again
     becomes available.

     On error -1 is returned.  The file must exist and the call may be exer-
     cised only by the super-user.

EERRRROORRSS
     AAcccctt() will fail if one of the following is true:

     [EPERM]       The caller is not the super-user.

     [ENOTDIR]     A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]      The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                   set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                   entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]      The named file does not exist.

     [EACCES]      Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                   prefix, or the path name is not a regular file.

     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.

     [EROFS]       The named file resides on a read-only file system.

     [EFAULT]      _F_i_l_e points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                   file system.
