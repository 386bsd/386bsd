       The  _m_s_y_n_c  system  call writes any modified pages back to
       the filesystem and updates the file modification time.  If
       _l_e_n  is 0, all modified pages within the region containing
       _a_d_d_r will be flushed; if _l_e_n is non-zero, only  the  pages
       containing _a_d_d_r and _l_e_n succeeding locations will be exam-
       ined.  Any required synchronization of memory caches  will
       also  take place at this time.  Filesystem operations on a
       file that is mapped for shared  modifications  are  unpre-
       dictable except after an _m_s_y_n_c.
