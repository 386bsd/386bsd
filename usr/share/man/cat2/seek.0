     The llsseeeekk() function repositions the offset of the file descriptor _f_i_l_d_e_s
     to the argument _o_f_f_s_e_t according to the directive _w_h_e_n_c_e. The argument
     _f_i_l_d_e_s must be an open file descriptor.  LLsseeeekk() repositions the file
     pointer _f_i_l_d_e_s as follows:

           If _w_h_e_n_c_e is SEEK_SET, the offset is set to _o_f_f_s_e_t bytes.

           If _w_h_e_n_c_e is SEEK_CUR, the offset is set to its current location
           plus _o_f_f_s_e_t bytes.

           If _w_h_e_n_c_e is SEEK_END, the offset is set to the size of the file
           plus _o_f_f_s_e_t bytes.

     The llsseeeekk() function allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of
     the existing end-of-file of the file. If data is later written at this
     point, subsequent reads of the data in the gap return bytes of zeros
     (until data is actualy written into the gap).

     Some devices are incapable of seeking.  The value of the pointer
     associated with such a device is undefined.

     Upon successful completion, llsseeeekk() returns the resulting offset location
     as measured in bytes from the begining of the file.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

EERRRROORRSS
     LLsseeeekk() will fail and the file pointer will remain unchanged if:

     [EBADF]   _F_i_l_d_e_s is not an open file descriptor.

     [ESPIPE]  _F_i_l_d_e_s is associated with a pipe, socket, or FIFO.

     [EINVAL]  _W_h_e_n_c_e is not a proper value.

     This document's use of _w_h_e_n_c_e is incorrect English, but maintained for
     historical reasons.

     The llsseeeekk() function conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (``POSIX'').
