     A symbolic link _n_a_m_e_2 is created to _n_a_m_e_1 (_n_a_m_e_2 is the name of the file
     created, _n_a_m_e_1 is the string used in creating the symbolic link).  Either
     name may be an arbitrary path name; the files need not be on the same
     file system.

     Upon successful completion, a zero value is returned.  If an error oc-
     curs, the error code is stored in _e_r_r_n_o and a -1 value is returned.

EERRRROORRSS
     The symbolic link succeeds unless:

     [ENOTDIR]
               A component of the _n_a_m_e_2 prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]  Either _n_a_m_e_1 or _n_a_m_e_2 contains a character with the high-order
               bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
               A component of either pathname exceeded 255 characters, or the
               entire length of either path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]  The named file does not exist.

     [EACCES]  A component of the _n_a_m_e_2 path prefix denies search permission.

     [ELOOP]   Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
               pathname.

     [EEXIST]  _N_a_m_e_2 already exists.

     [EIO]     An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry for
               _n_a_m_e_2, or allocating the inode for _n_a_m_e_2, or writing out the
               link contents of _n_a_m_e_2.

     [EROFS]   The file _n_a_m_e_2 would reside on a read-only file system.

     [ENOSPC]  The directory in which the entry for the new symbolic link is
               being placed cannot be extended because there is no space left
               on the file system containing the directory.

     [ENOSPC]  The new symbolic link cannot be created because there there is
               no space left on the file system that will contain the symbolic
               link.

     [ENOSPC]  There are no free inodes on the file system on which the sym-
               bolic link is being created.

     [EDQUOT]  The directory in which the entry for the new symbolic link is
               being placed cannot be extended because the user's quota of
               disk blocks on the file system containing the directory has


               been exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]  The new symbolic link cannot be created because the user's quo-
               ta of disk blocks on the file system that will contain the sym-
               bolic link has been exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]  The user's quota of inodes on the file system on which the sym-
               bolic link is being created has been exhausted.

     [EIO]     An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry or allo-
               cating the inode.

     [EFAULT]  _N_a_m_e_1 or _n_a_m_e_2 points outside the process's allocated address
               space.
