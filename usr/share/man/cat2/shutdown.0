     The sshhuuttddoowwnn() call causes all or part of a full-duplex connection on the
     socket associated with _s to be shut down.  If _h_o_w is 0, further receives
     will be disallowed.  If _h_o_w is 1, further sends will be disallowed.  If
     _h_o_w is 2, further sends and receives will be disallowed.
