     The device special file _p_a_t_h is created with the major and minor device
     numbers extracted from _m_o_d_e. The access permissions of _p_a_t_h are descen-
     dant from the umask(2) of the parent process.

     If _m_o_d_e indicates a block or character special file, _d_e_v is a configura-
     tion dependent specification of a character or block I/O device and the
     superblock of the device.  If _m_o_d_e does not indicate a block special or
     character special device, _d_e_v is ignored.

     MMkknnoodd() requires super-user privileges.

     Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     MMkknnoodd() will fail and the file will be not created if:

     [ENOTDIR]     A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]      The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                   set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                   entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]      A component of the path prefix does not exist.

     [EACCES]      Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                   prefix.

     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.

     [EPERM]       The process's effective user ID is not super-user.

     [EPERM]       The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                   set.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry or
                   allocating the inode.

     [ENOSPC]      The directory in which the entry for the new node is being
                   placed cannot be extended because there is no space left on
                   the file system containing the directory.

     [ENOSPC]      There are no free inodes on the file system on which the
                   node is being created.

     [EDQUOT]      The directory in which the entry for the new node is being
                   placed cannot be extended because the user's quota of disk
                   blocks on the file system containing the directory has been

                   exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]      The user's quota of inodes on the file system on which the
                   node is being created has been exhausted.

     [EROFS]       The named file resides on a read-only file system.

     [EEXIST]      The named file exists.

     [EFAULT]      _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address space.
