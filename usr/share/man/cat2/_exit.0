     The __eexxiitt() function terminates a process with the following conse-
     quences:

     oo   All of the descriptors open in the calling process are closed.  This
         may entail delays, for example, waiting for output to drain; a pro-
         cess in this state may not be killed, as it is already dying.

     oo   If the parent process of the calling process has an outstanding wait
         call or is interested in the SIGCHLD signal, it is notified of the
         calling process's termination and the _s_t_a_t_u_s area is set as defined
         by wait(2).

     oo   The parent process-ID of all of the calling process's existing child
         processes are set to 1; the initialization process (see the DEFINI-
         TIONS section of intro(2))  inherits each of these processes.  Any
         stopped children are restarted with a hangup signal (SIGHUP).

     Most C programs call the library routine exit(3),  which flushes buffers,
     closes streams, unlinks temporary files, etc., before calling __eexxiitt().
