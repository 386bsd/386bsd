       tar - tape (or other media) archive file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       A ``tar tape'' or file contains a series of records.  Each
       record contains RECORDSIZE bytes  (see  below).   Although
       this  format  may be thought of as being on magnetic tape,
       other media are often used.

       Each file archived is represented by a header record which
       describes the file, followed by zero or more records which
       give the contents of the file.  At the end of the  archive
       file  there may be a record filled with binary zeros as an
       end-of-file indicator.  A reasonable system should write a
       record  of  zeros  at the end, but must not assume that an
       end-of-file record exists when reading an archive.

       The records may be blocked for  physical  I/O  operations.
       Each  block  of _N records (where _N is set by the --bb option
       to _t_a_r) is written with a single  write()  operation.   On
       open  reel magnetic tapes, the result of such a write is a
       single tape record.  When writing  an  archive,  the  last
       block  of records should be written at the full size, with
       records after the zero record containing all zeroes.  When
       reading  an  archive,  a reasonable system should properly
       handle an archive whose last block  is  shorter  than  the
       rest,  or  which  contains  garbage  records  after a zero
       record.

       The header record is defined in the header file <tar.h> as
       follows:

       All  characters  in  header  records are represented using
       8-bit characters in the  local  variant  of  ASCII.   Each
       field  within  the structure is contiguous; that is, there
       is no padding used within the structure.   Each  character
       on the archive medium is stored contiguously.

       Bytes representing the contents of files (after the header
       record of each file) are not translated in any way and are
       not  constrained  to  represent characters or to be in any
       character set.  The _t_a_r(5)  format  does  not  distinguish
       text  files  from binary files, and no translation of file
       contents should be performed.

       The fields _n_a_m_e, _l_i_n_k_n_a_m_e, _m_a_g_i_c,  _u_n_a_m_e,  and  _g_n_a_m_e  are
       null-terminated  character  strings.  All other fields are
       zero-filled octal numbers in ASCII.   Each  numeric  field
       (of  width  _w)  contains  _w-2 digits, a space, and a null,
       except _s_i_z_e and _m_t_i_m_e, which do not contain  the  trailing
       null.

       The _n_a_m_e field is the pathname of the file, with directory
       names (if any)  preceding  the  file  name,  separated  by
       slashes.

       The   _m_o_d_e   field  provides  nine  bits  specifying  file
       permissions and three bits to specify the Set UID, Set GID
       and  Save  Text  (TSVTX) modes.  Values for these bits are
       defined above.  When special permissions are  required  to
       create  a  file  with a given mode, and the user restoring
       files from the archive does not hold such permissions, the
       mode  bit(s)  specifying  those  special  permissions  are
       ignored.  Modes which are not supported by  the  operating
       system  restoring  files from the archive will be ignored.
       Unsupported modes should be  faked  up  when  creating  an
       archive;  e.g.   the group permission could be copied from
       the `other' permission.

       The _u_i_d and _g_i_d fields are the user and group  ID  of  the
       file owners, respectively.

       The  _s_i_z_e  field  is the size of the file in bytes; linked
       files are archived with this field specified as zero.

       The _m_t_i_m_e field is the modification time of  the  file  at
       the  time it was archived.  It is the ASCII representation
       of the octal value of the last time the file was modified,
       represented  as in integer number of seconds since January
       1, 1970, 00:00 Coordinated Universal Time.

       The _c_h_k_s_u_m field is the ASCII representaion of  the  octal
       value of the simple sum of all bytes in the header record.
       Each 8-bit byte in the header is treated  as  an  unsigned
       value.   These  values  are  added to an unsigned integer,
       initialized to zero, the precision of which  shall  be  no
       less  than seventeen bits.  When calculating the checksum,
       the _c_h_k_s_u_m field is treated as if it were all blanks.

       The _t_y_p_e_f_l_a_g field specifies the type  of  file  archived.
       If  a  particular  implementation  does  not  recognize or
       permit the specified type, the file will be  extracted  as
       if  it  were  a  regular file.  As this action occurs, _t_a_r
       issues a warning to the standard error.

       LF_NORMAL or LF_OLDNORMAL
              represents   a   regular   file.    For    backward
              compatibility,  a  _t_y_p_e_f_l_a_g  value  of LF_OLDNORMAL
              should be silently recognized as  a  regular  file.
              New  archives  should  be  created using LF_NORMAL.
              Also, for  backward  compatability,  _t_a_r  treats  a
              regular  file  whose  name  ends  with a slash as a
              directory.

       LF_LINK
              represents a file linked to another  file,  of  any

              type,   previously   archived.    Such   files  are
              identified in Unix by each  file  having  the  same
              device  and  inode  number.   The linked-to name is
              specified in the _l_i_n_k_n_a_m_e  field  with  a  trailing
              null.

       LF_SYMLINK
              represents  a  symbolic  link to another file.  The
              linked-to name is specified in the  _l_i_n_k_n_a_m_e  field
              with a trailing null.

       LF_CHR or LF_BLK
              represent character special files and block special
              files respectively.  In this case the _d_e_v_m_a_j_o_r  and
              _d_e_v_m_i_n_o_r  fields  will  contain the major and minor
              device numbers respectively.  Operating systems may
              map  the  device  specifications to their own local
              specification, or may ignore the entry.

       LF_DIR specifies  a  directory  or   sub-directory.    The
              directory  name in the _n_a_m_e field should end with a
              slash.   On  systems  where  disk   allocation   is
              performed  on a directory basis the _s_i_z_e field will
              contain the maximum number of bytes (which  may  be
              rounded  to the nearest disk block allocation unit)
              which the directory may hold.  A _s_i_z_e field of zero
              indicates  no  such limiting.  Systems which do not
              support limiting in this manner should  ignore  the
              _s_i_z_e field.

       LF_FIFO
              specifies  a  FIFO  special  file.   Note  that the
              archiving of a FIFO file archives the existence  of
              this file and not its contents.

       LF_CONTIG
              specifies a contiguous file, which is the same as a
              normal file except that, in operating systems which
              support it, all its space is allocated contiguously
              on the disk.  Operating systems which do not  allow
              contiguous  allocation  should  silently treat this
              type as a normal file.

       `A' - `Z'
              are reserved for custom implementations.  None  are
              used by this version of the _t_a_r program.

       _o_t_h_e_r  values  are  reserved  for  specification in future
              revisions of the P1003 standard, and should not  be
              used by any _t_a_r program.

       The  _m_a_g_i_c field indicates that this archive was output in
       the P1003 archive format.  If this field contains  TMAGIC,
       then  the  _u_n_a_m_e  and  _g_n_a_m_e fields will contain the ASCII
