       _C_r_o_n_t_a_b  is the program used to install, deinstall or list
       the tables used to drive  the  _c_r_o_n_d(8)  daemon  in  Vixie
       Cron.   Each  user has their own crontab, and though these
       are files in /var, they are not readable  or  writable  by
       anyone  or  anything except the super-user or the _c_r_o_n_d(8)
       or _c_r_o_n_t_a_b programs.

       If the _a_l_l_o_w file exists, then you must be listed  therein
       in  order to be allowed to use this command.  If the _a_l_l_o_w
       file does not exist but the _d_e_n_y file does exist, then you
       must  nnoott  be listed in the _d_e_n_y file in order to use this
       command.  If neither of these files exists, then depending
       on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super
       user will be allowed to use this  command,  or  all  users
       will be able to use this command.

       If  the  -_u  option is given, it specifies the name of the
       user whose crontab is to be tweaked.  If  this  option  is
       not  given,  _c_r_o_n_t_a_b  examines  "your"  crontab, i.e., the
       crontab of the person executing the  command.   Note  that
       _s_u(8)  can  confuse  _c_r_o_n_t_a_b  and  that if you are running
       inside of _s_u(8) you should always use the  -_u  option  for
       safety's sake.

       The  -_l  option causes the current crontab to be displayed
       on standard output.

       The -_d option causes the current crontab to be deleted.

       The -_r option is used to replace the current  crontab  (if
       any) with the contents of the named file.

       A  fairly  informative usage message appears if you run it
       with a bad command line.
