     rreemmoottee - remote host description file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The systems known by tip(1) and their attributes are stored in an ASCII
     file which is structured somewhat like the termcap(5) file.  Each line in
     the file provides a description for a single system.  Fields are separat-
     ed by a colon (``:'').  Lines ending in a \ character with an immediately
     following newline are continued on the next line.

     The first entry is the name(s) of the host system.  If there is more than
     one name for a system, the names are separated by vertical bars.  After
     the name of the system comes the fields of the description.  A field name
     followed by an `=' sign indicates a string value follows.  A field name
     followed by a `#' sign indicates a following numeric value.

     Entries named ``tip*'' and ``cu*'' are used as default entries by tip,
     and the cu interface to tip,  as follows.  When tip is invoked with only
     a phone number, it looks for an entry of the form ``tip300'', where 300
     is the baud rate with which the connection is to be made.  When the cu
     interface is used, entries of the form ``cu300'' are used.

     Capabilities are either strings (str), numbers (num), or boolean flags
     (bool).  A string capability is specified by _c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_y=_v_a_l_u_e; for exam-
     ple, ``dv=/dev/harris''.  A numeric capability is specified by
     _c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_y#_v_a_l_u_e; for example, ``xa#99''.  A boolean capability is speci-
     fied by simply listing the capability.

     aatt      (str) Auto call unit type.

     bbrr      (num) The baud rate used in establishing a connection to the re-
             mote host.  This is a decimal number.  The default baud rate is
             300 baud.

     ccmm      (str) An initial connection message to be sent to the remote
             host.  For example, if a host is reached through port selector,
             this might be set to the appropriate sequence required to switch
             to the host.

     ccuu      (str) Call unit if making a phone call.  Default is the same as
             the `dv' field.

     ddii      (str) Disconnect message sent to the host when a disconnect is
             requested by the user.

     dduu      (bool) This host is on a dial-up line.

     ddvv      (str) UNIX device(s) to open to establish a connection.  If this
             file refers to a terminal line, tip(1) attempts to perform an ex-
             clusive open on the device to insure only one user at a time has
             access to the port.

     eell      (str) Characters marking an end-of-line.  The default is NULL.
             `~' escapes are only recognized by tip after one of the charac-
             ters in `el', or after a carriage-return.

     ffss      (str) Frame size for transfers.  The default frame size is equal
             to BUFSIZ.

     hhdd      (bool) The host uses half-duplex communication, local echo should


             be performed.

     iiee      (str) Input end-of-file marks.  The default is NULL.

     ooee      (str) Output end-of-file string.  The default is NULL. When tip
             is transferring a file, this string is sent at end-of-file.

     ppaa      (str) The type of parity to use when sending data to the host.
             This may be one of ``even'', ``odd'', ``none'', ``zero'' (always
             set bit 8 to zero), ``one'' (always set bit 8 to 1).  The default
             is even parity.

     ppnn      (str) Telephone number(s) for this host.  If the telephone number
             field contains an @ sign, tip searches the file /_e_t_c/_p_h_o_n_e_s file
             for a list of telephone numbers; (See phones(5).)

     ttcc      (str) Indicates that the list of capabilities is continued in the
             named description.  This is used primarily to share common capa-
             bility information.

     Here is a short example showing the use of the capability continuation
     feature:

     UNIX-1200:\
     :dv=/dev/cau0:el=^D^U^C^S^Q^O@:du:at=ventel:ie=#$%:oe=^D:br#1200:
     arpavax|ax:\
