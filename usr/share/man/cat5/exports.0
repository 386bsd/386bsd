     The eexxppoorrttss file specifies remote mount points for the NFS mount protocol
     per the NFS server specification; see _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _F_i_l_e _S_y_s_t_e_m _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
     _S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _R_F_C _1_0_9_4.

     Each line in the file specifies one remote mount point.  The first field
     is the mount point directory path followed optionally by export options
     and specific hosts separated by white space.  Only the first entry for a
     given local file system may specify the export options, since these are
     handled on a _p_e_r _l_o_c_a_l _f_i_l_e _s_y_s_t_e_m basis.  If no specific hosts are spec-
     ified, the mount point is exported to all hosts.

     The export options are as follows: --rroooott=<uuiidd> specifies how to map
     root's uid (default -2).  The option --rr is synonyms for --rroooott in an ef-
     fort to be backward compatible with older export file formats.

     --rroo specifies that the file system should be exported Read-only (default
     Read/Write).  The option --oo is synonyms for --rroo in an effort to be back-
     ward compatible with older export file formats.

     For example:

           /usr -root=0 rickers snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca
           /usr/local 131.104.48.16
           /u -root=5
           /u2 -ro

     Given that //uussrr, //uu and //uu22 are local file system mount points, the above
     example specifies the following:

           //uussrr is exported to hosts _r_i_c_k_e_r_s and _s_n_o_w_h_i_t_e._c_i_s._u_o_g_u_e_l_p_h._c_a with
           root mapped to root.

           //uussrr//llooccaall is exported to host _1_3_1._1_0_4._4_8._1_6 with root mapped to
           root.

           //uu is exported to all hosts with root mapped to uid 5.

           //uu22 is exported to all hosts Read-only with root mapped to -2.

     Note that ``/usr/local -root=5'' would have been incorrect, since //uussrr
     and //uussrr//llooccaall reside in the same local file system.

FFIILLEESS
     /etc/exports  The remote mount point file eexxppoorrttss resides in /_e_t_c.

     mountd(8),  nfsd(8),  showmount(8)

BBUUGGSS
     It would be nice if the export options were not tied to local mount
     points.

     The eexxppoorrttss file format is currently under development.
