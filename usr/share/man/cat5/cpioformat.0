     ccppiioo - format of cpio archive

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The header structure, when the --cc option of cpio(1) is not used, is:

           struct {
                   short   h_magic,
                           h_dev;
                   ushort  h_ino,
                           h_mode,
                           h_uid,
                           h_gid;
                   short   h_nlink,
                           h_rdev,
                           h_mtime[2],
                           h_namesize,
                           h_filesize[2];
                   char    h_name[h_namesize rounded to word];
           } Hdr;

     When the --cc option is used, the header information is described by:

           sscanf(Chdr,"%6o%6o%6o%6o%6o%6o%6o%6o%11lo%6o%11lo%s",
           &Hdr.h_magic, &Hdr.h_dev, &Hdr.h_ino, &Hdr.h_mode,
           &Hdr.h_uid, &Hdr.h_gid, &Hdr.h_nlink, &Hdr.h_rdev,
           &Longtime, &Hdr.h_namesize,&Longfile,Hdr.h_name);

     _L_o_n_g_t_i_m_e and _L_o_n_g_f_i_l_e are equivalent to _H_d_r._h__m_t_i_m_e and _H_d_r._h__f_i_l_e_s_i_z_e,
     respectively.  The contents of each file are recorded in an element of
     the array of varying lenght structures, archive, together with other
     items describing the file.  Every instance of _h__m_a_g_i_c contains the
     constant 070707 (octal).  The itimes _h__d_e_v through _h__m_t_i_m_e have meanings
     explained in stat(2).  The length of the null-terminated path name
     _H__n_a_m_e, icluding the null byte, is given by _h__n_a_m_e_s_i_z_e.

     The last record of the archive always contains the name TRAILER!!!.
     Special files, directories, and the trailer are recorded with _H__f_i_l_e_s_i_z_e
     equal to zero.

     A cpio(1) command appeared in AT&T System V UNIX.  This file format is
     derived from the AT&T System V UNIX sources which were contributed to the
     public domain by AT&T.
