     ttttyyss - terminal initialization information

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The file ttttyyss contains information that is used by various routines to
     initialize and control the use of terminal special files.  This informa-
     tion is read with the getttyent(3) library routines.  The There is one
     line in the ttttyyss file per special device file.  Fields are separated by
     tabs and/or spaces.  Fields comprised of more than one word should be en-
     closed in double quotes (``"'').  Blank lines and comments may appear
     anywhere in the file; comments are delimited by hash marks (``#'') and
     new lines.  Any unspecified fields will default to null.

     The first field is the name of the terminal special file as it is found
     in /_d_e_v.

     The second field of the file is the command to execute for the line, usu-
     ally getty(8),  which initializes and opens the line, setting the speed,
     waiting for a user name and executing the login(1) program.  It can be,
     however, any desired command, for example the start up for a window sys-
     tem terminal emulator or some other daemon process, and can contain mul-
     tiple words if quoted.

     The third field is the type of terminal usually connected to that tty
     line, normally the one found in the termcap(5) data base file.  The envi-
     ronment variable TERM is initialized with the value by either getty(8) or
     login(1).

     The remaining fields set flags in the _t_y__s_t_a_t_u_s entry (see getttyent(3))
     or specify a window system process that init(8) will maintain for the
     terminal line.

     As flag values, the strings ``on'' and ``off'' specify that init should
     (should not) execute the command given in the second field, while ``se-
     cure'' (if ``on'' is also specified) allows users with a uid of 0 to lo-
     gin on this line.  These flag fields should not be quoted.

     The string ``window='' may be followed by a quoted command string which
     init will execute _b_e_f_o_r_e starting the command specified by the second
     field.
