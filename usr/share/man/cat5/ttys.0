     ttttyyss - terminal initialization information

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The file ttttyyss contains information that is used by various routines to
     initialize and control the use of terminal special files.  This
     information is read with the getttyent(3) library routines.  The There is
     one line in the ttttyyss file per special device file.  Fields are separated
     by tabs and/or spaces.  Fields comprised of more than one word should be
     enclosed in double quotes (``"'').  Blank lines and comments may appear
     anywhere in the file; comments are delimited by hash marks (``#'') and
     new lines.  Any unspecified fields will default to null.

     The first field is the name of the terminal special file as it is found
     in /_d_e_v.

     The second field of the file is the command to execute for the line,
     usually getty(8),  which initializes and opens the line, setting the
     speed, waiting for a user name and executing the login(1) program.  It
     can be, however, any desired command, for example the start up for a
     window system terminal emulator or some other daemon process, and can
     contain multiple words if quoted.

     The third field is the type of terminal usually connected to that tty
     line, normally the one found in the termcap(5) data base file.  The
     environment variable TERM is initialized with the value by either
     getty(8) or login(1).

     The remaining fields set flags in the _t_y__s_t_a_t_u_s entry (see getttyent(3))
     or specify a window system process that init(8) will maintain for the
     terminal line.

     As flag values, the strings ``on'' and ``off'' specify that init should
     (should not) execute the command given in the second field, while
     ``secure'' (if ``on'' is also specified) allows users with a uid of 0 to
     login on this line.  These flag fields should not be quoted.

     The string ``window='' may be followed by a quoted command string which
     init will execute _b_e_f_o_r_e starting the command specified by the second
     field.
