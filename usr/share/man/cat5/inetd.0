     IInneettdd should be run at boot time by /_e_t_c/_r_c._l_o_c_a_l (see rc(8)).  It then
     listens for connections on certain internet sockets.  When a connection
     is found on one of its sockets, it decides what service the socket corre-
     sponds to, and invokes a program to service the request.  After the pro-
     gram is finished, it continues to listen on the socket (except in some
     cases which will be described below).  Essentially, iinneettdd allows running
     one daemon to invoke several others, reducing load on the system.

     The option available for iinneettdd::

     --dd      Turns on debugging.

     Upon execution, iinneettdd reads its configuration information from a configu-
     ration file which, by default, is /_e_t_c/_i_n_e_t_d._c_o_n_f. There must be an entry
     for each field of the configuration file, with entries for each field
     separated by a tab or a space.  Comments are denoted by a ``#'' at the
     beginning of a line.  There must be an entry for each field.  The fields
     of the configuration file are as follows:

           service name
           socket type
           protocol
           wait/nowait
           user
           server program
           server program arguments

     The _s_e_r_v_i_c_e-_n_a_m_e entry is the name of a valid service in the file
     /_e_t_c/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s. For ``internal'' services (discussed below), the service
     name _m_u_s_t be the official name of the service (that is, the first entry
     in /_e_t_c/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s).

     The _s_o_c_k_e_t-_t_y_p_e should be one of ``stream'', ``dgram'', ``raw'', ``rdm'',
     or ``seqpacket'', depending on whether the socket is a stream, datagram,
     raw, reliably delivered message, or sequenced packet socket.

     The _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l must be a valid protocol as given in /_e_t_c/_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s. Exam-
     ples might be ``tcp'' or ``udp''.

     The _w_a_i_t/_n_o_w_a_i_t entry is applicable to datagram sockets only (other sock-
     ets should have a ``nowait'' entry in this space).  If a datagram server
     connects to its peer, freeing the socket so iinneettdd can received further
     messages on the socket, it is said to be a ``multi-threaded'' server, and
     should use the ``nowait'' entry.  For datagram servers which process all
     incoming datagrams on a socket and eventually time out, the server is
     said to be ``single-threaded'' and should use a ``wait'' entry.  Com-
     sat(8) (biff(1))  and talkd(8) are both examples of the latter type of
     datagram server.  Tftpd(8) is an exception; it is a datagram server that
     establishes pseudo-connections.  It must be listed as ``wait'' in order
     to avoid a race; the server reads the first packet, creates a new socket,
     and then forks and exits to allow iinneettdd to check for new service requests
     to spawn new servers.

     The _u_s_e_r entry should contain the user name of the user as whom the serv-
     er should run.  This allows for servers to be given less permission than
     root.

     The _s_e_r_v_e_r-_p_r_o_g_r_a_m entry should contain the pathname of the program which
     is to be executed by iinneettdd when a request is found on its socket.  If
     iinneettdd provides this service internally, this entry should be
     ``internal''.

     The _s_e_r_v_e_r _p_r_o_g_r_a_m _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s should be just as arguments normally are,
     starting with argv[0], which is the name of the program.  If the service
     is provided internally, the word ``internal'' should take the place of
     this entry.

     IInneettdd provides several ``trivial'' services internally by use of routines
     within itself.  These services are ``echo'', ``discard'', ``chargen''
     (character generator), ``daytime'' (human readable time), and ``time''
     (machine readable time, in the form of the number of seconds since mid-
     night, January 1, 1900).  All of these services are tcp based.  For de-
     tails of these services, consult the appropriate RFC from the Network In-
     formation Center.

     IInneettdd rereads its configuration file when it receives a hangup signal,
     SIGHUP. Services may be added, deleted or modified when the configuration
     file is reread.
