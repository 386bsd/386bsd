     sseerrvviicceess - service name data base

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The sseerrvviicceess file contains information regarding the known services
     available in the DARPA Internet.  For each service a single line should
     be present with the following information:

           official service name
           port number
           protocol name
           aliases

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  The
     port number and protocol name are considered a single _i_t_e_m; a ``/'' is
     used to separate the port and protocol (e.g. ``512/tcp'').  A ``#'' indi-
     cates the beginning of a comment; subsequent characters up to the end of
     the line are not interpreted by the routines which search the file.

     Service names may contain any printable character other than a field de-
     limiter, newline, or comment character.
