     ggrroouupp - format of the group permissions file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The file </_e_t_c/_g_r_o_u_p> consists of newline separated ASCII records, one
     per group, containing four colon `:' separated fields. These fields are
     as follows:
           group     Name of the group.
           passwd    Group's _e_n_c_r_y_p_t_e_d password.
           gid       The group's decimal ID.
           member    Group members.

     The _g_r_o_u_p field is the group name used for granting file access to users
     who are members of the group.  The _g_i_d field is the number associated
     with the group name.  They should both be unique across the system (and
     often across a group of systems) since they control file access.  The
     _p_a_s_s_w_d field is an optional _e_n_c_r_y_p_t_e_d password.  This field is rarely
     used and an asterisk is normally placed in it rather than leaving it
     blank.  The _m_e_m_b_e_r field contains the names of users granted the priv-
     iledges of _g_r_o_u_p. The member names are separated by commas with out
     spaces or newlines.  A user is automatically in a group if that group was
     specified in their /_e_t_c/_p_a_s_s_w_d entry and does not need to be added to
     that group in the /_e_t_c/_g_r_o_u_p _f_i_l_e.
