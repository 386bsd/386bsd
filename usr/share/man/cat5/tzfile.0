     The time zone information files used by tzset(3) begin with bytes re-
     served for future use, followed by four four-byte values of type _l_o_n_g,
     written in a ``standard'' byte order (the high-order byte of the value is
     written first).  These values are, in order:

     _t_z_h__t_t_i_s_s_t_d_c_n_t  The number of standard/wall indicators stored in the
                     file.

     _t_z_h__l_e_a_p_c_n_t     The number of leap seconds for which data is stored in
                     the file.

     _t_z_h__t_i_m_e_c_n_t     The number of "transition times" for which data is stored
                     in the file.

     _t_z_h__t_y_p_e_c_n_t     The number of "local time types" for which data is stored
                     in the file (must not be zero).

     _t_z_h__c_h_a_r_c_n_t     The number of characters of "time zone abbreviation
                     strings" stored in the file.

     The above header is followed by _t_z_h__t_i_m_e_c_n_t four-byte values of type
     _l_o_n_g, sorted in ascending order.  These values are written in ``stan-
     dard'' byte order.  Each is used as a transition time (as returned by
     time(2))  at which the rules for computing local time change.  Next come
     _t_z_h__t_i_m_e_c_n_t one-byte values of type _u_n_s_i_g_n_e_d _c_h_a_r; each one tells which
     of the different types of ``local time'' types described in the file is
     associated with the same-indexed transition time.  These values serve as
     indices into an array of _t_t_i_n_f_o structures that appears next in the file;
     these structures are defined as follows:

           struct ttinfo {
                   long    tt_gmtoff;
                   int     tt_isdst;
                   unsigned int    tt_abbrind;
           };

     Each structure is written as a four-byte value for _t_t__g_m_t_o_f_f of type
     _l_o_n_g, in a standard byte order, followed by a one-byte value for _t_t__i_s_d_s_t
     and a one-byte value for _t_t__a_b_b_r_i_n_d. In each structure, _t_t__g_m_t_o_f_f gives
     the number of seconds to be added to GMT, _t_t__i_s_d_s_t tells whether _t_m__i_s_d_s_t
     should be set by localtime(3) and _t_t__a_b_b_r_i_n_d serves as an index into the
     array of time zone abbreviation characters that follow the _t_t_i_n_f_o struc-
     ture(s) in the file.

     Then there are _t_z_h__l_e_a_p_c_n_t pairs of four-byte values, written in standard
     byte order; the first value of each pair gives the time (as returned by
     time(2))  at which a leap second occurs; the second gives the _t_o_t_a_l num-
     ber of leap seconds to be applied after the given time.  The pairs of
     values are sorted in ascending order by time.

     Finally there are _t_z_h__t_t_i_s_s_t_d_c_n_t standard/wall indicators, each stored as
     a one-byte value; they tell whether the transition times associated with
     local time types were specified as standard time or wall clock time, and
     are used when a time zone file is used in handling POSIX-style time zone
     environment variables.


     _L_o_c_a_l_t_i_m_e uses the first standard-time _t_t_i_n_f_o structure in the file (or
     simply the first _t_t_i_n_f_o structure in the absence of a standard-time
     structure) if either _t_z_h__t_i_m_e_c_n_t is zero or the time argument is less
     than the first transition time recorded in the file.
