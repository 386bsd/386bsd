     hhoossttss - host name data base

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The hhoossttss file contains information regarding the known hosts on the net-
     work.  For each host a single line should be present with the following
     information:

           official host name
           Internet address
           aliases

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  A
     ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of
     the line are not interpreted by routines which search the file.

     When using the name server named(8),  this file provides a backup when
     the name server is not running.  For the name server, it is suggested
     that only a few addresses be included in this file.  These include  ad-
     dress for the local interfaces that ifconfig(8) needs at boot time and a
     few machines on the local network.

     This file may be created from the official host data base maintained at
     the Network Information Control Center (NIC), though local changes may be
     required to bring it up to date regarding unofficial aliases and/or un-
     known hosts.  As the data base maintained at NIC is incomplete, use of
     the name server is recommend for sites on the DARPA Internet.

     Network addresses are specified in the conventional ``.'' (dot) notation
     using the inet_addr(3) routine from the Internet address manipulation li-
     brary, inet(3).  Host names may contain any printable character other
     than a field delimiter, newline, or comment character.
