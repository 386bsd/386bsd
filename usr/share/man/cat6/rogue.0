       _R_o_g_u_e  is a computer fantasy game with a new twist.  It is
       crt oriented and the object of the game is to survive  the
       attacks  of various monsters and get a lot of gold, rather
       than the puzzle solving orientation of most computer  fan-
       tasy games.

       To  get started you really only need to know two commands.
       The command ??  will give you a list of the available  com-
       mands  and  the command // will identify the things you see
       on the screen.

       To win the game (as opposed  to  merely  playing  to  beat
       other  people's high scores) you must locate the Amulet of
       Yendor which is somewhere below the 20th level of the dun-
       geon  and get it out.  Nobody has achieved this yet and if
       somebody does, they will probably go down in history as  a
       hero among heroes.

       When  the  game ends, either by your death, when you quit,
       or if you (by some miracle) manage to win, _r_o_g_u_e will give
       you  a  list of the top-ten scorers.  The scoring is based
       entirely upon how much gold  you  get.   There  is  a  10%
       penalty for getting yourself killed.

       If _s_a_v_e__f_i_l_e is specified, rogue will be restored from the
       specified saved game file.

       The --ss option will print out the list of scores.

       For more detailed directions, read the document _A _G_u_i_d_e _t_o
