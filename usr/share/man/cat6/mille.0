       _M_i_l_l_e  plays  a  two-handed game reminiscent of the Parker
       Brother's game of Mille Bournes with you.  The  rules  are
       described  below.   If a file name is given on the command
       line, the game saved in that file is started.

       When a game is started up, the bottom of the score  window
       will contain a list of commands.  They are:

       P      Pick  a card from the deck.  This card is placed in
              the `P' slot in your hand.

       D      Discard a card from your hand.  To  indicate  which
              card, type the number of the card in the hand (or P
              for the just-picked card) followed by a <RETURN> or
              <SPACE>.   The  <RETURN  or  <SPACE> is required to
              allow recovery from typos which can be very  expen-
              sive, like discarding safeties.

       U      Use  a  card.   The  card is again indicated by its
              number, followed by a <RETURN> or <SPACE>.

       O      Toggle ordering  the  hand.   By  default  off,  if
              turned  on  it  will  sort  the  cards in your hand
              appropriately.  This is  not  recommended  for  the
              impatient on slow terminals.

       Q      Quit  the  game.   This  will ask for confirmation,
              just to be sure.  Hitting <DELETE> (or <RUBOUT>) is
              equivalent.

       S      Save  the  game in a file.  If the game was started
              from a file, you will be given  an  opportunity  to
              save it on the same file.  If you don't wish to, or
              you did not start from a file, you  will  be  asked
              for  the file name.  If you type a <RETURN> without
              a name, the save will be terminated  and  the  game
              resumed.

       R      Redraw  the  screen  from  scratch.  The command ^L
              (control `L') will also work.

       W      Toggle window type.  This switches the score window
              between  the  startup  window (with all the command
              names) and the end-of-game window.  Using the  end-
              of-game window saves time by eliminating the switch
              at the end of the game to  show  the  final  score.
              Recommended for hackers and other miscreants.

       If you make a mistake, an error message will be printed on
       the last line of the score window, and a bell will beep.

       At the end of each hand or game, you will be asked if  you
       wish to play another.  If not, it will ask you if you want
       to save the game.  If you do, and the save  is  unsuccess-
       ful, play will be resumed as if you had said you wanted to
       play another hand/game.  This allows you to use the S com-
       mand to reattempt the save.

       Here is some useful information.  The number in  parenthe-
       ses  after the card name is the number of that card in the
       deck:

RRUULLEESS
       OObbjjeecctt: The point of this game is to get a total  of  5000
       points  in several hands.  Each hand is a race to put down
       exactly 700 miles before your opponent does.   Beyond  the
       points  gained  by putting down milestones, there are sev-
       eral other ways of making points.

       OOvveerrvviieeww: The game is played with a  deck  of  101  cards.
       _D_i_s_t_a_n_c_e cards represent a number of miles traveled.  They
       come in denominations of 25, 50, 75, 100, and  200.   When
       one  is  played,  it  adds that many miles to the player's
       trip so far this hand.  _H_a_z_a_r_d cards are used  to  prevent
       your  opponent from putting down Distance cards.  They can
       only be played if your opponent has a _G_o card  on  top  of
       the Battle pile.  The cards are _O_u_t _o_f _G_a_s, _A_c_c_i_d_e_n_t, _F_l_a_t
       _T_i_r_e, _S_p_e_e_d _L_i_m_i_t, and _S_t_o_p.  _R_e_m_e_d_y  cards  fix  problems
       caused  by  Hazard  cards  played on you by your opponent.
       The cards are _G_a_s_o_l_i_n_e, _R_e_p_a_i_r_s, _S_p_a_r_e _T_i_r_e, _E_n_d _o_f _L_i_m_i_t,
       and  _G_o.   _S_a_f_e_t_y cards prevent your opponent from putting
       specific Hazard cards on you in the first place.  They are

       and there are only one of each in the deck.

       BBooaarrdd LLaayyoouutt: The board is split into several areas.  From
       top  to bottom, they are: SSAAFFEETTYY AARREEAA (unlabeled): This is
       where the safeties will be  placed  as  they  are  played.
       HHAANNDD:  These  are the cards in your hand.  BBAATTTTLLEE: This is
       the Battle pile.  All the  Hazard  and  Remedy  Cards  are
       played  here,  except  the  _S_p_e_e_d  _L_i_m_i_t  and _E_n_d _o_f _L_i_m_i_t
       cards.  Only the top card is displayed, as it is the  only
       effective  one.   SSPPEEEEDD:  The Speed pile.  The _S_p_e_e_d _L_i_m_i_t
       and _E_n_d _o_f _L_i_m_i_t cards are  played  here  to  control  the
       speed  at  which  the player is allowed to put down miles.
       MMIILLEEAAGGEE: Miles are placed here.  The total of the  numbers
       shown here is the distance traveled so far.

       PPllaayy:  The  first pick alternates between the two players.
       Each turn usually starts with a pick from the  deck.   The
       player  then  plays  a card, or if this is not possible or
       desirable, discards one.  Normally, a play or discard of a
       single  card  constitutes a turn.  If the card played is a
       safety, however, the same player takes another turn  imme-
       diately.

       This  repeats  until one of the players reaches 700 points
       or the deck runs out.  If someone reaches 700,  they  have
       the option of going for an _E_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n, which means that the
       play continues until someone reaches 1000 miles.

       HHaazzaarrdd aanndd RReemmeeddyy CCaarrddss: Hazard Cards are played  on  your
       opponent's  Battle and Speed piles.  Remedy Cards are used
       for undoing the effects of your opponent's nastiness.

           GGoo (Green Light) must be the top card on  your  Battle
       pile  for  you to play any mileage, unless you have played
       the _R_i_g_h_t _o_f _W_a_y card (see below).
           SSttoopp is played on your opponent's _G_o card  to  prevent
       them from playing mileage until they play a _G_o card.
           SSppeeeedd  LLiimmiitt  is played on your opponent's Speed pile.
       Until they play an _E_n_d _o_f _L_i_m_i_t they can only play  25  or
       50  mile  cards, presuming their _G_o card allows them to do
       even that.
           EEnndd ooff LLiimmiitt is played on your Speed pile to nullify a
       _S_p_e_e_d _L_i_m_i_t played by your opponent.
           OOuutt ooff GGaass is played on your opponent's _G_o card.  They
       must then play a _G_a_s_o_l_i_n_e card, and then a _G_o card  before
       they can play any more mileage.
           FFllaatt  TTiirree is played on your opponent's _G_o card.  They
       must then play a _S_p_a_r_e _T_i_r_e  card,  and  then  a  _G_o  card
       before they can play any more mileage.
           AAcccciiddeenntt  is  played on your opponent's _G_o card.  They
       must then play a _R_e_p_a_i_r_s card, and then a _G_o  card  before
       they can play any more mileage.

       SSaaffeettyy  CCaarrddss:  Safety  cards  prevent  your opponent from
       playing the corresponding Hazard cards on you for the rest
       of the hand.  It cancels an attack in progress, and _a_l_w_a_y_s

           RRiigghhtt ooff WWaayy prevents your opponent from playing  both
       _S_t_o_p and _S_p_e_e_d _L_i_m_i_t cards on you.  It also acts as a per-
       manent _G_o card for the rest of the hand, so you  can  play
       mileage  as  long  as there is not a Hazard card on top of
       your Battle pile.  In this case only,  your  opponent  can
       play  Hazard  cards directly on a Remedy card other than a
       Go card.
           EExxttrraa TTaannkk When played, your opponent cannot  play  an
       _O_u_t _o_f _G_a_s on your Battle Pile.
           PPuunnccttuurree  PPrrooooff When played, your opponent cannot play
       a _F_l_a_t _T_i_r_e on your Battle Pile.
           DDrriivviinngg AAccee When played, your opponent cannot play  an
       _A_c_c_i_d_e_n_t on your Battle Pile.

       DDiissttaannccee  CCaarrddss: Distance cards are played when you have a
       _G_o card on your Battle pile, or a Right  of  Way  in  your
       Safety  area  and  are not stopped by a Hazard Card.  They
       can be played in any combination that totals  exactly  700
       miles,  except that _y_o_u _c_a_n_n_o_t _p_l_a_y _m_o_r_e _t_h_a_n _t_w_o _2_0_0 _m_i_l_e
       _c_a_r_d_s _i_n _o_n_e _h_a_n_d.  A hand ends whenever one  player  gets
       exactly  700  miles  or  the deck runs out.  In that case,
       play continues until neither someone reaches 700, or  nei-
       ther  player can use any cards in their hand.  If the trip
       is completed after the  deck  runs  out,  this  is  called
       _D_e_l_a_y_e_d _A_c_t_i_o_n.

       CCoouupp  FFoouurrrr''ee: This is a French fencing term for a counter-
       thrust move as part of a parry to an opponents attack.  In
       Mille Bournes, it is used as follows: If an opponent plays
       a Hazard card, and you have the  corresponding  Safety  in
       your  hand, you play it immediately, even _b_e_f_o_r_e you draw.
       This immediately removes the Hazard card from your  Battle
       pile,  and protects you from that card for the rest of the
       game.  This gives you more points (see Scoring below).

       SSccoorriinngg: Scores are totaled  at  the  end  of  each  hand,
       whether  or not anyone completed the trip.  The terms used
       in the Score window have the following meanings:
           MMiilleessttoonneess PPllaayyeedd: Each player scores as many miles as
       they played before the trip ended.
           EEaacchh  SSaaffeettyy: 100 points for each safety in the Safety
       area.
