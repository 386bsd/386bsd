# This is pretty trivial, since all the functionality was moved into
# uucp itself.  The -t means to interpret the final argument as
# system!user, the -R means to copy directories recursively, and the
# -c means to not copy the files to the spool directory (may be
# overriden by -C or -p).

exec /usr/local/bin/uucp -t -R -c $*
