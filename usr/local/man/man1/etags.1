.SH DESCRIPTION
The `\|\fBetags\fP\|' program is used to create a tag table file, in a format
understood by 
.BR emacs ( 1 )\c
\&; the `\|\fBctags\fP\|' program is used to create a similar table in a
format understood by
.BR vi ( 1 )\c
\&.  Both forms of the program understand
the syntax of C, Fortran, Pascal, LaTeX, Scheme, Emacs Lisp/Common Lisp
and most assembler\-like syntaxes. 
Both forms read the files specified on the command line, and write a tag
table (defaults: `\|TAGS\|' for \fBetags\fP, `\|tags\|' for
\fBctags\fP) in the current working directory. 
The programs recognize the language used in an input file based on its
file name and contents; there are no switches for specifying the language.  
.SH OPTIONS
Some options make sense only for the \fBvi\fP style tag files produced
by ctags;
\fBetags\fP does not recognize them.
The programs accept unambiguous abbreviations for long option names.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-append
Append to existing tag file.  (For vi-format tag files, see also
\fB\-\-update\fP.)
.TP
.B \-B, \-\-backward\-search
Tag files written in the format expected by \fBvi\fP contain regular
expression search instructions; the \fB\-B\fP option writes them using
the delimiter `\|\fB?\fP\|', to search \fIbackwards\fP through files.
The default is to use the delimiter `\|\fB/\fP\|', to search \fIforwards\fP
through files.
Only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-c++
Treat files with `\|.c\|' and `\|.h\|' extensions as C++ code, not C
code.  Files with `\|.C\|', `\|.H\|', `\|.cxx\|', `\|.hxx\|', or
`\|.cc\|' extensions are always assumed to be C++ code.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-defines
Create tag entries for C preprocessor definitions, too.  This is the
default behavior for \fBetags\fP, so this option is only accepted
by \fBctags\fP.
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-no\-defines
Do not create tag entries for C preprocessor definitions.
This may make the tags file much smaller if many header files are tagged.
This is the default behavior for \fBctags\fP, so this option is only
accepted by \fBetags\fP.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP \fIfile\fP, \fB\-\-include=\fIfile\fP
Include a note in tag file indicating that, when searching for a tag,
one should also consult the tags file \fIfile\fP after checking the
current file.  Only \fBetags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fItagfile\fP, \fB\-\-output=\fItagfile\fP
Explicit name of file for tag table; overrides default `\|TAGS\|' or
`\|tags\|'.   (But ignored with \fB\-v\fP or \fB\-x\fP.)
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-ignore\-indentation
Don't rely on indentation as much as we normally do.  Currently, this
means not to assume that a closing brace in the first column is the
final brace of a function or structure definition in C and C++.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-typedefs
Record typedefs in C code as tags.  Since this is the default behaviour
of \fBetags\fP, only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-typedefs\-and\-c++
Generate tag entries for typedefs, struct, enum, and union tags, and
C++ member functions.  Since this is the default behaviour
of \fBetags\fP, only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-update
Update tag entries for \fIfiles\fP specified on command line, leaving
tag entries for other files in place.  Currently, this is implemented
by deleting the existing entries for the given files and then
rewriting the new entries at the end of the tags file.  It is often
faster to simply rebuild the entire tag file than to use this.
Only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-vgrind
Instead of generating a tag file, write index (in \fBvgrind\fP format)
to standard output.  Only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-no\-warn
Suppress warning messages about duplicate entries.  The \fBetags\fP
program does not check for duplicate entries, so this option is not
allowed with it.
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-cxref
Instead of generating a tag file, write a cross reference (in
\fBcxref\fP format) to standard output.  Only \fBctags\fP accepts this option.
.TP
.B \-H, \-\-help
Print usage information.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print the current version of the program (same as the version of the
emacs \fBetags\fP is shipped with).
