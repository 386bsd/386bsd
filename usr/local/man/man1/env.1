.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR env .
.B env
runs a command with an environment modified as specified by the
command line arguments.  Arguments of the form `variable=value' set
the environment variable
.I variable
to value
.IR value .
.I value
may be empty (`variable=').  Setting a variable to an empty value is
different from unsetting it.
.PP
The first remaining argument specifies a program to invoke; it is
searched for according to the specification of the PATH environment
variable.  Any arguments following that are passed as arguments to
that program.
.PP
If no command name is specified following the environment
specifications, the resulting environment is printed.  This is like
specifying a command name of `printenv'.
