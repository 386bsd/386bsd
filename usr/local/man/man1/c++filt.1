.SH DESCRIPTION
The C++ language provides function overloading, which means that you can
write many functions with the same name (providing each takes parameters
of different types).  All C++ function names are encoded into a
low-level assembly label (this process is known as
.I mangling\c
).  The 
.B c++filt
program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (\fIdemangles\fR)
low-level names into user-level names so that the linker can keep
these overloaded functions from clashing.
.PP
Every alphanumeric word (consisting of letters, digits, underscores,
dollars, or periods) seen in the input is a potential label.  If the
label decodes into a C++ name, the C++ name replaces the low-level
name in the output.
.PP
You can use
.B c++filt
to decipher individual symbols by specifying these symbols on the
command line.
.PP
If no
.B symbol
arguments are given,
.B c++filt
reads symbol names from the standard input and writes the demangled
names to the standard output.  All results are printed on the standard
output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-_
.TP
.B \-\-strip\-underscores
On some systems, both the C and C++ compilers put an
underscore in front of every name.  For example, the C name 
.B foo
gets the low-level name 
.BR _foo .
This option removes the leading underscore.

.TP
.B "\-s {gnu,lucid,arm}"
.TP
.B \-\-format={gnu,lucid,arm}
GNU
.B nm
can decode three different methods of mangling, used by different C++
compilers.  This option selects which method it uses: the one used by
the GNU compiler, the one used by the Lucid compiler, or the one
specified by the C++ Annotated Reference Manual.  The default is the
GNU style.

.TP
.B \-\-help
Print a summary of the options to
.B c++filt
and exit.

.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the version number of
.B c++filt
and exit.
