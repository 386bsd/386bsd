.SH DESCRIPTION
.I GNU Emacs
is a new version of 
.I Emacs,
written by the author of the original (PDP-10) 
.I Emacs,
Richard Stallman.  
Its user functionality encompasses
everything other 
.I Emacs 
editors do, and it is easily extensible since its
editing commands are written in Lisp.
.PP
.I Emacs
has an extensive interactive help facility,
but the facility assumes that you know how to manipulate
.I Emacs
windows and buffers.
CTRL-h (backspace
or CTRL-h) enters the Help facility.  Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t)
requests an interactive tutorial which can teach beginners the fundamentals
of 
.I Emacs 
in a few minutes.
Help Apropos (CTRL-h a) helps you
find a command given its functionality, Help Character (CTRL-h c)
describes a given character's effect, and Help Function (CTRL-h f)
describes a given Lisp function specified by name.
.PP
.I Emacs's
Undo can undo several steps of modification to your buffers, so it is
easy to recover from editing mistakes.
.PP
.I GNU Emacs's
many special packages handle mail reading (RMail) and sending (Mail),
outline editing (Outline), compiling (Compile), running subshells
within
.I Emacs
windows (Shell), running a Lisp read-eval-print loop
(Lisp-Interaction-Mode), and automated psychotherapy (Doctor).
.PP
There is an extensive reference manual, but
users of other Emacses
should have little trouble adapting even
without a copy.  Users new to
.I Emacs
will be able
to use basic features fairly rapidly by studying the tutorial and
using the self-documentation features.
.PP
.SM Emacs Options
.PP
The following options are of general interest:
.TP 8
.I file
Edit
.I file.
.TP
.BI \+ number
Go to the line specified by
.I number
(do not insert a space between the "+" sign and
the number).
.TP
.B \-q
Do not load an init file.
.TP
.BI \-u " user"
Load
.I user's
init file.
.TP
.BI \-t " file"
Use specified
.I file
as the terminal instead of using stdin/stdout.
This must be the first argument specified in the command line.
.PP
The following options are lisp-oriented
(these options are processed in the order encountered):
.TP 8
.BI \-f " function"
Execute the lisp function
.I function.
.TP
.BI \-l " file"

.I file.
.PP
The following options are useful when running
.I Emacs
as a batch editor:
.TP 8
.BI \-batch " commandfile"

.I commandfile.
The editor will send messages to stdout.
This option must be the first in the argument list.
.TP
.B \-kill
Exit 
.I Emacs 
while in batch mode.
.\" START DELETING HERE IF YOU'RE NOT USING X
.PP
.SM Using Emacs with X
.PP
.I Emacs
has been tailored to work well with the X window system.
If you run
.I Emacs
from under X windows, it will create its own X window to
display in.  You will probably want to start the editor
as a background process
so that you can continue using your original window.
.PP
.I Emacs
can be started with the following X switches:
.TP 8
.BI \-rn " name"
Specifies the program name which should be used when looking up
defaults in the user's X resources.  This must be the first option
specified in the command line.
.TP 8
.BI \-name " name"
Specifies the name which should be assigned to the
.I Emacs
window.
.TP 8
.B \-r
Display the
.I Emacs
window in reverse video.
.TP
.B \-i
Use the "kitchen sink" bitmap icon when iconifying the
.I Emacs
window.
.TP
.BI \-font " font, " \-fn " font"
Set the
.I Emacs
window's font to that specified by
.I font.
You will find the various
.I X
fonts in the
.I /usr/lib/X11/fonts
directory.
Note that
.I Emacs
will only accept fixed width fonts.
Under the X11 Release 4 font-naming conventions, any font with the
value "m" or "c" in the eleventh field of the font name is a fixed
width font.  Furthermore, fonts whose name are of the form
.IR width x height
are generally fixed width, as is the font
.IR fixed .
See
.IR xlsfonts (1)
for more information.

When you specify a font, be sure to put a space between the
switch and the font name.
.TP
.BI \-b " pixels"
Set the
.I Emacs
window's border width to the number of pixels specified by
.I pixels.
Defaults to one pixel on each side of the window.
.TP
.BI \-ib " pixels"
Set the window's internal border width to the number of pixels specified
by 
.I pixels.
Defaults to one pixel of padding on each side of the window.
.PP
.TP 8
.BI \-geometry " geometry"
Set the
.I Emacs
window's width, height, and position as specified.  The geometry
specification is in the standard X format; see
.IR X (1)
for more information.
The width and height are specified in characters; the default is 80 by
24.
.PP
.TP 8
.BI \-fg " color"
On color displays, sets the color of the text.

See the file
.I /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt
for a list of valid
color names.
.TP
.BI \-bg " color"
On color displays,
sets the color of the window's background.
.TP
.BI \-bd " color"
On color displays,
sets the color of the window's border.
.TP
.BI \-cr " color"
On color displays,
sets the color of the window's text cursor.
.TP
.BI \-ms " color"
On color displays,
sets the color of the window's mouse cursor.
.TP
.BI \-d " displayname, " \-display " displayname"
Create the
.I Emacs
window on the display specified by
.IR displayname .
Must be the first option specified in the command line.
.TP
.B \-nw
Tells
.I Emacs
not to use its special interface to X.  If you use this
switch when invoking
.I Emacs
from an
.IR xterm (1)
window, display is done in that window.
This must be the first option specified in the command line.
.PP
You can set
.I X
default values for your
.I Emacs
windows in your
.I \.Xresources
file (see
.IR xrdb (1)).
Use the following format:
.IP
emacs.keyword:value
.PP
where
.I value
specifies the default value of
.I keyword.
.I Emacs
lets you set default values for the following keywords:
.TP 8
.B font (\fPclass\fB Font)
Sets the window's text font.
.TP
.B reverseVideo (\fPclass\fB ReverseVideo)
If
.I reverseVideo's
value is set to
.I on,
the window will be displayed in reverse video.
.TP
.B bitmapIcon (\fPclass\fB BitmapIcon)
If
.I bitmapIcon's
value is set to
.I on,
the window will iconify into the "kitchen sink."
.TP
.B borderWidth (\fPclass\fB BorderWidth)
Sets the window's border width in pixels.
.TP
.B internalBorder (\fPclass\fB BorderWidth)
Sets the window's internal border width in pixels.
.TP
.B foreground (\fPclass\fB Foreground)
For color displays,
sets the window's text color.
.TP
.B background (\fPclass\fB Background)
For color displays,
sets the window's background color.
.TP
.B borderColor (\fPclass\fB BorderColor)
For color displays,
sets the color of the window's border.
.TP
.B cursorColor (\fPclass\fB Foreground)
For color displays,
sets the color of the window's text cursor.
.TP
.B pointerColor (\fPclass\fB Foreground)
For color displays,
sets the color of the window's mouse cursor.
.TP

.SH MANUALS
You can order printed copies of the GNU Emacs Manual for $20.00/copy
postpaid from the Free Software Foundation, which develops GNU software
(contact them for quantity prices on the manual).  Their address is:
.nf
    Free Software Foundation
    675 Mass Ave.
    Cambridge, MA 02139
.fi
Your local Emacs maintainer might also have copies available.  As
with all software and publications from FSF, everyone is permitted to
make and distribute copies of the Emacs manual.  The TeX source to the
manual is also included in the Emacs source distribution.
.PP
.SH FILES
/usr/local/info - files for the Info documentation browser
(a subsystem of Emacs) to refer to.  Currently not much of Unix
is documented here, but the complete text of the Emacs reference
manual is included in a convenient tree structured form.

/usr/local/lib/emacs/$VERSION/src - C source files and object files

/usr/local/lib/emacs/$VERSION/lisp - Lisp source files and compiled files
that define most editing commands.  Some are preloaded;
others are autoloaded from this directory when used.
  
/usr/local/lib/emacs/$VERSION/etc - various programs that are used with
GNU Emacs, and some files of information.

/usr/local/lib/emacs/$VERSION/etc/DOC.* - contains the documentation
strings for the Lisp primitives and preloaded Lisp functions
of GNU Emacs.  They are stored here to reduce the size of
Emacs proper.

/usr/local/lib/emacs/$VERSION/etc/DIFF discusses GNU Emacs vs. Twenex
Emacs;
.br
/usr/local/lib/emacs/$VERSION/etc/CCADIFF discusses GNU Emacs vs. CCA
Emacs;
.br
/usr/local/lib/emacs/$VERSION/etc/GOSDIFF discusses GNU Emacs
vs. Gosling Emacs.
.br
/usr/local/lib/emacs/$VERSION/etc/SERVICE lists people offering
various services to assist users of GNU Emacs, including education,
troubleshooting, porting and customization.
.br
These files also have information useful to anyone wishing to write
programs in the Emacs Lisp extension language, which has not yet been fully
documented.

/usr/local/lib/emacs/lock - holds lock files that are made for all
files being modified in Emacs, to prevent simultaneous modification
of one file by two users.

/usr/local/lib/emacs/$VERSION/$ARCHITECTURE/cpp - the GNU cpp, needed
for building Emacs on certain versions of Unix where the standard cpp
cannot handle long names for macros.

.SH BUGS
There is a mailing list, bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu on the internet
(ucbvax!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gnu-emacs on UUCPnet), for reporting Emacs
bugs and fixes.  But before reporting something as a bug, please try
to be sure that it really is a bug, not a misunderstanding or a
deliberate feature.  We ask you to read the section ``Reporting Emacs
Bugs'' near the end of the reference manual (or Info system) for hints
on how and when to report bugs.  Also, include the version number of
the Emacs you are running in \fIevery\fR bug report that you send in.

Do not expect a personal answer to a bug report.  The purpose of reporting
bugs is to get them fixed for everyone in the next release, if possible.
For personal assistance, look in the SERVICE file (see above) for
a list of people who offer it.

Please do not send anything but bug reports to this mailing list.
Send requests to be added to mailing lists to the special list
info-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu (or the corresponding UUCP
address).  For more information about Emacs mailing lists, see the
file /usr/local/emacs/etc/MAILINGLISTS.  Bugs tend actually to be
fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in your interest to report
them in such a way that they can be easily reproduced.
.PP
Bugs that I know about are: shell will not work with programs
running in Raw mode on some Unix versions.
.SH UNRESTRICTIONS
.PP
.I Emacs 
is free; anyone may redistribute copies of 
.I Emacs 
to
anyone under the terms stated in the 
.I Emacs 
General Public License,
a copy of which accompanies each copy of 
.I Emacs 
and which also
appears in the reference manual.
.PP
Copies of
.I Emacs
may sometimes be received packaged with distributions of Unix systems,
but it is never included in the scope of any license covering those
systems.  Such inclusion violates the terms on which distribution
is permitted.  In fact, the primary purpose of the General Public
License is to prohibit anyone from attaching any other restrictions
to redistribution of 
.I Emacs.
.PP
Richard Stallman encourages you to improve and extend 
.I Emacs, 
and urges that
you contribute your extensions to the GNU library.  Eventually GNU
(Gnu's Not Unix) will be a complete replacement for Berkeley
Unix.
Everyone will be able to use the GNU system for free.
