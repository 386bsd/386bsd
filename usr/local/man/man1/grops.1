.TH GROPS 1 "14 February 1994" "Groff Version 1.09"
.SH NAME
grops \- PostScript driver for groff
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B grops
[
.B \-glv
] [
.BI \-b n
] [
.BI \-c n
] [
.BI \-w n
] [
.BI \-F dir

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B grops
translates the output of GNU
.B troff
to PostScript.
Normally
.B grops
should be invoked by using the groff command
with a
.B \-Tps
option.
.if 'ps'ps' (Actually, this is the default for groff.)
If no files are given,
.B grops
will read the standard input.
A filename of
.B \-
will also cause
.B grops
to read the standard input.
PostScript output is written to the standard output.
When
.B grops
is run by
.B groff
options can be passed to
.B grops
using the
.B groff
.B \-P
option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-b n
Workaround broken spoolers and previewers.
Normally
.B grops
produces output that conforms
the Document Structuring Conventions version 3.0.
Unfortunately some spoolers and previewers can't handle such output.
The value of
.I n
controls what
.B grops
does to its output acceptable to such programs.
A value of 0 will cause grops not to employ any workarounds.
Add 1 if no
.B %%BeginDocumentSetup
and
.B %%EndDocumentSetup
comments should be generated;
this is needed for early versions of TranScript that get confused by
anything between the
.B %%EndProlog
comment and the first
.B %%Page
comment.
Add 2 if lines in included files beginning with
.B %!
should be stripped out; this is needed for Sun's pageview previewer.
Add 4 if
.BR %%Page ,
.BR %%Trailer
and
.B %%EndProlog
comments should be
stripped out of included files; this is needed for spoolers that
don't understand the
.B %%BeginDocument
and
.B %%EndDocument
comments.
Add 8 if the first line of the PostScript output should be
.B %!PS-Adobe-2.0
rather than
.BR %!PS-Adobe-3.0 ;
this is needed when using Sun's Newsprint with a printer that requires
page reversal.
The default value can be specified by a
.RS
.IP
.BI broken\  n
.LP
command in the DESC file.
Otherwise the default value is 0.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-c n
Print
.I n
copies of each page.
.TP
.BI \-g
Guess the page length.
This generates PostScript code that guesses the page length.
The guess will be correct only if the imageable area is vertically
centered on the page.
This option allows you to generate documents that can be printed
both on letter (8.5\(mu11) paper and on A4 paper without change.
.TP
.BI \-l
Print the document in landscape format.
.TP
.BI \-F dir
Search the directory
.IB dir /dev name
for font and device description files;
.I name
is the name of the device, usually
.BR ps .
.TP
.BI \-w n
Lines should be drawn using a thickness of
.I n
thousandths of an em.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.
.SH USAGE
There are styles called
.BR R ,
.BR I ,
.BR B ,
and
.B BI
mounted at font positions 1 to 4.
The fonts are grouped into families
.BR A ,
.BR BM ,
.BR C ,
.BR H ,
.BR HN ,
.BR N ,
.B P
and
.B T
having members in each of these styles:

.LP
There are also some special fonts called
.B SS
and
.BR S .
Zapf Dingbats is available as
.BR ZD
and a reversed version of ZapfDingbats (with symbols pointing in the opposite
direction) is available as
.BR ZDR ;
most characters in these fonts are unnamed and must be accessed using
.BR \eN .
.LP
.B grops
understands various X commands produced using the
.B \eX
escape sequence;
.B grops
will only interpret commands that begin with a
.B ps:
tag.
.TP
.BI \eX'ps:\ exec\  code '
This executes the arbitrary PostScript commands in
.IR code .
The PostScript currentpoint will be set to the position of the
.B \eX
command before executing
.IR code .
The origin will be at the top left corner of the page,
and y coordinates will increase down the page.
A procedure
.B u
will be defined that converts groff units
to the coordinate system in effect.
For example, 
.RS
.IP
.B
\&.nr x 1i
.br
.B
\eX'ps: exec \enx u 0 rlineto stroke'
.br
.RE
.IP
will draw a horizontal line one inch long.
.I code
may make changes to the graphics state,
but any changes will persist only to the
end of the page.
A dictionary containing the definitions specified by the
.B def
and
.B mdef
will be on top of the dictionary stack.
If your code adds definitions to this dictionary,
you should allocate space for them using
.BI \eX'ps\ mdef \ n '\fR.
Any definitions will persist only until the end of the page.
If you use the
.B \eY
escape sequence with an argument that names a macro,
.I code
can extend over multiple lines.
For example,
.RS
.IP
.nf
.ft B
\&.nr x 1i
\&.de y
\&ps: exec
\&\enx u 0 rlineto
\&stroke
\&..
\&\eYy
.fi
.ft R
.LP
is another way to draw a horizontal line one inch long.
.RE
.TP
.BI \eX'ps:\ file\  name '
This is the same as the
.B exec
command except that the PostScript code is read from file
.IR name .
.TP
.BI \eX'ps:\ def\  code '
Place a PostScript definition contained in
.I code
in the prologue.
There should be at most one definition per
.B \eX
command.
Long definitions can be split over several
.B \eX
commands;
all the
.I code
arguments are simply joined together separated by newlines.
The definitions are placed in a dictionary which is automatically
pushed on the dictionary stack when an
.B exec
command is executed.
If you use the
.B \eY
escape sequence with an argument that names a macro,
.I code
can extend over multiple lines.
.TP
.BI \eX'ps:\ mdef\  n\ code  '
Like
.BR def ,
except that
.I code
may contain up to
.I n
definitions.
.B grops
needs to know how many definitions
.I code
contains
so that it can create an appropriately sized PostScript dictionary
to contain them.
.TP
.BI \eX'ps:\ import\  file\ llx\ lly\ urx\ ury\ width\ \fR[\fP\ height\ \fR]\fP '
Import a PostScript graphic from
.IR file .
The arguments
.IR llx ,
.IR lly ,
.IR urx ,
and
.I ury
give the bounding box of the graphic in the default PostScript
coordinate system; they should all be integers;
.I llx
and
.I lly
are the x and y coordinates of the lower left
corner of the graphic;
.I urx
and
.I ury
are the x and y coordinates of the upper right corner of the graphic;
.I width
and
.I height
are integers that give the desired width and height in groff
units of the graphic.
The graphic will be scaled so that it has this width and height
and translated so that the lower left corner of the graphic is
located at the position associated with
.B \eX
command.
If the height argument is omitted it will be scaled uniformly in the
x and y directions so that it has the specified width.
Note that the contents of the
.B \eX
command are not interpreted by
.BR troff ;
so vertical space for the graphic is not automatically added,
and the
.I width
and
.I height
arguments are not allowed to have attached scaling indicators.
If the PostScript file complies with the Adobe Document Structuring
Conventions and contains a
.B %%BoundingBox
comment, then the bounding box can be automatically
extracted from within groff by using the
.B sy
request to run the
.B psbb
command.
.RS
.LP
The
.B \-mps
macros (which are automatically loaded when
.B grops
is run by the groff command) include a
.B PSPIC
macro which allows a picture to be easily imported.
This has the format
.IP
\&\fB.PSPIC\fP \fI\|file\fP [ \fB\-L\fP | \fB-R\fP | \fB\-I\fP \fIn\fP ]\  
[ \fIwidth\fP [ \fIheight\fP ]]
.LP
.I file
is the name of the file containing the illustration;
.I width
and
.I height
give the desired width and height of the graphic.
The
.I width
and
.I height
arguments may have scaling indicators attached;
the default scaling indicator is
.BR i .
This macro will scale the graphic uniformly
in the x and y directions so that it is no more than
.I width
wide
and
.I height
high.
By default, the graphic will be horizontally centered.
The
.BI \-L
and
.BI \-R
cause the graphic to be left-aligned and right-aligned
respectively.
The
.B \-I
option causes the graphic to be indented by
.IR n .
.RE
.TP
.B \eX'ps:\ invis'
.br
.ns
.TP
.B \eX'ps:\ endinvis'
No output will be generated for text and drawing commands
that are bracketed with these
.B \eX
commands.
These commands are intended for use when output from
.B troff
will be previewed before being processed with
.BR grops ;
if the previewer is unable to display certain characters
or other constructs, then other substitute characters or constructs
can be used for previewing by bracketing them with these
.B \eX
commands.
.RS
.LP
For example,
.B gxditview
is not able to display a proper
.B \e(em
character because the standard X11 fonts do not provide it;
this problem can be overcome by executing the following
request
.IP
.ft B
.nf
\&.char \e(em \eX'ps: invis'\e
\eZ'\ev'-.25m'\eh'.05m'\eD'l .9m 0'\eh'.05m''\e
\eX'ps: endinvis'\e(em
.ft
.fi
.LP
In this case,
.B gxditview
will be unable to display the
.B \e(em
character and will draw the line,
whereas
.B grops
will print the
.B \e(em
character
and ignore the line.
.RE
.LP
The input to
.B grops
must be in the format output by
.BR gtroff (1).
This is described in
.BR groff_out (1).
In addition the device and font description files for the device used
must meet certain requirements.
The device and font description files supplied for
.B ps
device meet all these requirements.
.BR afmtodit (1)
can be used to create font files from AFM files.
The resolution must be an integer multiple of 72 times the
.BR sizescale .
The
.B ps
device uses a resolution of 72000 and a sizescale of 1000.
The device description file should contain a command
.IP
.BI paperlength\  n
.LP
which says that output should be generated which is suitable for
printing on a page whose length is
.I n
machine units.
Each font description file must contain a command
.IP
.BI internalname\  psname
.LP
which says that the PostScript name of the font is
.IR psname .
It may also contain a command
.IP
.BI encoding\  enc_file
.LP
which says that
the PostScript font should be reencoded using the encoding described in
.IR enc_file ;
this file should consist of a sequence of lines of the form:
.IP
.I
pschar code
.LP
where
.I pschar
is the PostScript name of the character,
and
.I code
is its position in the encoding expressed as a decimal integer.
The code for each character given in the font file must correspond
to the code for the character in encoding file, or to the code in the default
encoding for the font if the PostScript font is not to be reencoded.
This code can be used with the
.B \eN
escape sequence in
.B troff
to select the character,
even if the character does not have a groff name.
Every character in the font file must exist in the PostScript font, and 
the widths given in the font file must match the widths used
in the PostScript font.
.B grops
will assume that a character with a groff name of
.B space
is blank (makes no marks on the page);
it can make use of such a character to generate more efficient and
compact PostScript output.
.LP
.B grops
can automatically include the downloadable fonts necessary
to print the document.
Any downloadable fonts which should, when required, be included by
.B grops
must be listed in the file
.BR /usr/lib/groff/font/devps/download ;
this should consist of lines of the form
.IP
.I
font  filename
.LP
where
.I font
is the PostScript name of the font,
and
.I filename
is the name of the file containing the font;
lines beginning with
.B #
and blank lines are ignored;
fields may be separated by tabs or spaces;
.I filename
will be searched for using the same mechanism that is used
for groff font metric files.
The
.B download
file itself will also be searched for using this mechanism.
.LP
If the file containing a downloadable font or imported document
conforms to the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions,
then
.B grops
will interpret any comments in the files sufficiently to ensure that its
own output is conforming.
It will also supply any needed font resources that are listed in the
.B download
file
as well as any needed file resources.
It is also able to handle inter-resource dependencies.
For example, suppose that you have a downloadable font called Garamond,
and also a downloadable font called Garamond-Outline
which depends on Garamond
(typically it would be defined to copy Garamond's font dictionary,
and change the PaintType),
then it is necessary for Garamond to be appear before Garamond-Outline
in the PostScript document.
.B grops
will handle this automatically
provided that the downloadable font file for Garamond-Outline
indicates its dependence on Garamond by means of
the Document Structuring Conventions,
for example by beginning with the following lines
.IP
.B
%!PS-Adobe-3.0 Resource-Font
.br
.B
%%DocumentNeededResources: font Garamond
.br
.B
%%EndComments
.br
.B
%%IncludeResource: font Garamond
.LP
In this case both Garamond and Garamond-Outline would need to be listed
in the
.B download
file.
A downloadable font should not include its own name in a
.B %%DocumentSuppliedResources
comment.
.LP
.B grops
will not interpret 
.B %%DocumentFonts
comments.
The
.BR %%DocumentNeededResources ,
.BR %%DocumentSuppliedResources ,
.BR %%IncludeResource ,
.BR %%BeginResource
and
.BR %%EndResource
comments
(or possibly the old
.BR %%DocumentNeededFonts ,
.BR %%DocumentSuppliedFonts ,
.BR %%IncludeFont ,
.BR %%BeginFont
and
.BR %%EndFont
comments)
should be used.
