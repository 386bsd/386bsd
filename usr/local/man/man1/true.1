.SH NAME
true \- do nothing, successfully
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B true
.br
.B true
{\-\-help,\-\-version}
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.B true
(and probably every other version, as well).
.B true
does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning ``success''.
It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where a successful
command is needed, although the shell built-in command `:' (colon)
does the same thing faster.
.SS OPTIONS
When GNU
.B true
is invoked with exactly one argument, the following options are recognized:
.TP
.I "\-\-help"
Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.
.TP
.I "\-\-version"
Print version information on standard output then exit successfully.
