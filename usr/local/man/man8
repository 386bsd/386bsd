.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The gopherindex program is used to make full-text indexes for a Gopher
server.  It uses the underlying indexing mechanism, either WAIS, or the
NeXT Digital Librarian to create the indexes.
.PP
Gopherindex uses 
.B waisindex
to generate indexes for sites using WAIS.
For sites using NeXT indexing, gopherindex uses
.B ixBuild.
These programs must be in the current path for this script to work.
.PP
.B -v
.RS 3
Specifies verbose output.  Otherwise only error messages are output.
.RE
.B -N
.RS 3
specifies the name of the Index as it should appear to gopher
users.  Remember to quote your name if it uses spaces.
.RE
.B -t
.RS 3
specifies the type of indexing to use.  This is only really useful if
you are on a NeXT with both WAIS and NeXT indexing capabilities.
Specify 
.B wais
for wais indices.  Specify 
.B next
for NeXT indices.
.RE
.B -wais
.RS 3
Specifies extra arguments to be passed to the 
.B waisindex 
command.  These options will need to be quoted so they are not
processed by the script.  See the EXAMPLES section.

.SH EXAMPLES

.PP
The following command indexes all of the files inside of 
.B /home/joeboy/gopher-data/courses
with verbose output and makes a link name of 
.B "Search CIS Short Courses".

.RS 3
 /usr/local/bin/gopherindex -v -N \\
   "Search CIS Services Short Courses" \\
   /home/joeboy/gopher-data/courses
.RE

.PP
The following command uses wais to all of the files in 
.B /home/joeboy/gopher-data/providers/bookstore
with verbose output.  The 
.B -wais "-t dash" 
specifies that 
.B waisindex 
should consider all of the files to have subdocuments separated by
lines of dashes.

.RS 3
 /usr/local/bin/gopherindex -v -N \\
   "Search Minnesota Bookcenter electronics inventory" \\
   -wais "-t dash" \\
   /home/joeboy/gopher-data/providers/bookstore
