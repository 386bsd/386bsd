	news.texi: invocation-name now exists.

Sat Mar 27 00:00:16 1993  Eric S. Raymond  (eric@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

Fri Mar 19 22:56:22 1993  Eric S. Raymond  (eric@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	ChangeLogs are correct,	dired and mail and process control are now
	fully supported.

	* NEWS: Added finder news.

Fri Mar 19 21:12:13 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

Fri Mar 19 02:16:28 1993  Eric S. Raymond  (eric@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* MACHINES: `Last updated 10 Feb 1992.' was obviously wrong, so
	I nuked it.  Let the file mod date serve.  Merged in APOLLO and
	SUNBUG files.  Changed references to 18.* to past tense.

	* emacs.names: merged into JOKES.  I faked a mail header from the
	Unknown User to delimit the first (unheaded) bit.

	* Makefile (relock, unlock): New productions.

Thu Mar 18 18:33:42 1993  Eric S. Raymond  (eric@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	Augean-stable cleaning time.  Partly to save space, but mostly to
	reduce the dizzying amount of *stuff* confronting someone exploring
	the Emacs distribution, I have the following changes in the etc
	directory:

	* CHARACTERS: merged into TO-DO file under the heading "Long Range:"

	* DIFF, CCADIFF and GOSDIFF: merged into a new outline file titled
	OTHER.EMACSES.  The present names don't really convey anything.
	Various key bindings and feature descriptions have been updated.

	* NICKLES.WORTH.  Nuked.  This is copyrighted material that could land
	FSF in hot water.

	* INTERVAL.IDEAS:  Nuked.  RMS's thinking, and indeed the
	implementation of intervals, have progressed way beyond this.

	* RCP:  Nuked.  It no longer said anything but "Ooops, sorry!"

	* ED.WORSHIP, GNU.JOKES: merged into a mailbox called JOKES.
	Future jokes can accumulate there.

	* DISTRIB: the actual domestic order form is now ORDERS.USA.
	The DISTRIB text now mentions 19.

	* ORDERS.USA: created.  This is just the order form.  DISTRIB
	has a pointer to it at the beginning.

	* EUROPE: renamed to ORDERS.EUROPE.  DISTRIB now has a pointer
	to it at the beginning.

	* OOOONEWS, OOOONEWS: Nuked.  It's version  19 --- nobody needs the
	version 15 and 17 files anymore.

	All files marked "Nuked" have actually been moved to =-prefixed
	names as per convention.  Originals of all files merged still
	exist with =-names.

Wed Mar 17 18:14:56 1993  Eric S. Raymond  (eric@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* XENIX: nuked (moved to =XENIX).  The hackery it describes is
	no longer necessary in the presence of 19's function-key-map
	feature; I've added an explanation to the beginning of the file.

Wed Mar 10 23:00:51 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* MACHINES: Update description of SYSVr3 and r4 support, due to
	Eric Raymond's changes.

Tue Mar  9 10:57:57 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* MACHINES: Mention that you have to edit the configure script
	when you add support for a new machine, to get it to recognize the
	configuration name.

Fri Nov 20 06:25:30 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* MACHINES: Converted to use GCC-style configuration names,
	instead of listing m/*.h and s/*.h files.  All knowledge of m/ and
	s/ files now lives in ../configure.

Tue Oct  6 17:27:33 1992  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* NEWS: Document included tags tables.

Wed Jul 22 19:29:49 1992  Eric S. Raymond  (eric@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Corrected the news about VC to reflect reality.

Fri Jul 17 16:04:32 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.1: New file, from Richard K. Pixley at Cygnus.

Wed Jun 24 18:00:06 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile: Most of the contents of this file were only relevant
	to things in `../lib-src'; removed all but the `distclean' and
	`clean' targets.

Tue Apr 14 17:59:46 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* COPYING: Got June 1991 version of the GPL here.

	* ChangeLog: Since the old etc contents have been split into etc
	and lib-src, the old etc's ChangeLog has been duplicated in the
	new etc and lib-src.  That means that each contains complete and
	coherent information, although each contains extraneous
	information.	 

Wed Apr  8 00:54:55 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* lib-src/etags.c: "--no-warning" option renamed to "--no-warn",
	to be consistent with other GNU programs, like makeinfo.

	* lib-src/Makefile: Renamed to Makefile.in; the configure script
	will edit this to produce Makefile.

Tue Apr  7 02:39:25 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* etags.c (print_help, print_version): New functions.
	(main): Options added to support them.

	* etags.c (longopts): New array of long names for the options.
	(main): Recognize them.

Mon Apr  6 22:29:38 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* etags.c (C_entries): Removed comment saying that \" in a string
	isn't recognized as magic, because it is correctly handled.

	* getopt.c, getopt.h: New files, from GNU C library.
	* etags.c: Rewritten to use getopt.
	#include "getopt.h".
	(file_num): Variable deleted; its role is now played by getopt's
	optind.
	(main): Argument processing loop rewritten to call getopt to get
	next option.  Options which take parameters (-o and -i) rewritten
	to get parameter from optarg instead of argv[1].  Filename
	preprocessing loop and update command changed similarly.
	* Makefile (etags, ctags): Depend on and link with getopt.h,
	getopt.o, and getopt1.o.
	(getopt.o, getopt1.o): New targets for the GNU getopt routines.

	* etags.c (outfflag): Variable deleted; it is non-zero iff outfile
	is non-zero.

	(main): In the argument processing loop, the 'goto next_arg'
	statements are breaking out of the switch statement in exactly the
	same way that a simple 'break' statement would; replace the gotos
	with breaks, and remove the label.

Mon Apr  6 17:29:21 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (C_entries): Clear tydef and next_token_is_func at start.
	(consider_token): Move next_token_is_func to global.

Thu Apr  2 02:03:48 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	(mostlyclean): New target, synonymous with clean.
	(TAGS, check): New targets.
	(INSTALL, INSTALLFLAGS): New variables.

Tue Mar 31 10:30:56 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

    	* lib-src/Makefile, etc/MACHINES, etc/NEWS: Changed references to
	`config.emacs' to `configure'.

	* lib-src/Makefile: Adjusted for renaming of share-lib to etc.
	* etc/MACHINES: Same.

Mon Mar 30 21:34:42 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* movemail.c (main): Allow tempname to be as long as necessary,
	instead of limiting it to 39 characters.

	* movemail.c (main): Move declaration of buf from top of function
	to local block surrounding the copy loop.  This makes it less
	likely to be confused with the buf used by the code which checks the
	permissions on outname's directory.

Fri Mar 20 08:58:40 1992  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@albert.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* SERVICE: Remove my entry.

Mon Mar  9 12:24:19 1992  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile (emacstool, nemacstool, xvetool): Use ${CFLAGS}, not
	hardcoded -g.

	* movemail.c (xmalloc): Return char *, not int.
	(main) [!MAIL_USE_FLOCK]: Add a new conditional, MAIL_UNLINK_SPOOL,
	that is off by default -- normally don't unlink the mail spool
	file, just empty it.  Pass creat mode 0600, not 0666.

Fri Feb  7 16:28:01 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb at pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile (../arch-lib): Depend on ${EXECUTABLES}.
	(all): Instead of here.
	(install): Don't use the -s option, since people need symbols to
	debug code.

Sun Jan 19 11:29:00 1992    (Eric Youngdale at youngdale@v6550c.nrl.navy.mil)

	* etags-vmslib.c (fn_exp): Add type cast.

	(popmail): Close output before deleting messages.

	* etags.c (main): Properly cast call to alloca that initializes
	included_files.

Sat Aug 17 21:33:34 1991  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (files_are_tag_tables): Remove global var.
	(process_file): Don't test it.  Also remove hack checking for a
	file named "TAGS".
	(main): -i now takes an arg which is the name of a file to include.

	* make-docfile: Find the arguments to a C function correctly,
	by not ignoring the character that read_c_string returns.  Don't
	even try to find argument names for functions that take MANY
	or UNEVALLED arguments, since they're a figment of the docstring's
	imagination.

Mon Jan 14 18:47:17 1991  Jim Blandy  (jimb at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-docfile: Read the .elc files generated by the new byte
