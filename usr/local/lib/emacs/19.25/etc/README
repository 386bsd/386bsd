This directory contains the architecture-independent files used by or
with Emacs.  This includes some text files of documentation for GNU
Emacs or of interest to Emacs users, and the file of dumped docstrings
for Emacs functions and variables.

`termcap.dat' is for VMS.  It is a copy of the `/etc/termcap' file
used on Unix.
