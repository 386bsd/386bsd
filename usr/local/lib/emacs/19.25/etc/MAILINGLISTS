     GNU Project Electronic Mailing Lists.  Last Updated 23 Feb 94

	   Please report improvements to: gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu

* GNU mailing lists are also distributed as USENET news groups

The mailing lists are gated both ways with the gnu.all newsgroups at
ohio-state.edu.  The one-to-one correspondence is indicated below.  If
you don't know if your site is on USENET, ask your system administrator.
If you are a USENET site and don't get the gnu.all newsgroups, please
ask your USENET administrator to get them.  If he has your feeds ask
their feeds, you should win.  And everyone else wins: newsgroups make
better use of the limited bandwidth of the computer networks and your
home machine than mailing list traffic; and staying off the mailing
lists make better use of the people who maintain the lists and the
machines that the GNU people working with rms use (i.e. we have more
time to produce code!!).  Thanx.

* Getting the mailing lists directly

If several users at your site or local network want to read a list and
you aren't a USENET site, Project GNU would prefer that you would set up
one address that redistributes locally.  This reduces overhead on our
people and machines, your gateway machine, and the network(s) used to
transport the mail from us to you.

* How to subscribe to and report bugs in mailing lists

Send messages ABOUT these lists, such as reports of mail problems, or
requests to be added or removed, to help-gnu-emacs-request (or
info-gnu-request, bug-gdb-request, etc.), NOT to info-gnu-emacs (or
info-gnu, etc.).  These <LIST_NAME>-request addresses go only to the
people who can do something about your requests or problems, and thus
avoids disturbing everyone else.

Note that all GNU mailing lists are maintained by volunteers.  They get
behind occasionally.  Wait at least 3 or 4 days before asking again.
Thanks!

Many of the GNU mailing lists are very large and are received by many
people.  Please don't send them anything that is not seriously important
to all their readers.  All GNU mailing lists are unmoderated, mail
reflectors, except info-gnu, info-gnu-emacs, info-gcc, info-g++,
info-gnu-fortran, info-gnu-utils, info-gnu-chess and info-gnu-shogi.

All addresses below are in internet format.  Consult the mail guru for
your computer to figure out address syntaxes from other networks.  From
UUCP machines:
	..!ucbvax!prep.ai.mit.edu!ADDRESS
	..!uunet!prep.ai.mit.edu!ADDRESS

If a message you mail to a list is returned from a MAILER-DAEMON (often
with the line:
      ----- Transcript of session follows -----
 don't resend the message to the list.  All this return means is that
your original message failed to reach a few addresses on the list.  Such
messages are NEVER a reason to resend a piece of mail a 2nd time.  This
just bothers all (less the few delivery failures (which will probably
just fail again!)) of the readers of the list with a message they have
already seen.  It also wastes computer and network resources.

It is appropriate to send these to the -request address for a list, and
ask them to check the problem out.

* Send Specific Requests for Information to: gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu

Specific requests for information about obtaining GNU software, or GNU
activities in Cambridge and elsewhere can be directed to:
	gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu

* General Information about all lists

Please keep each message under 25,000 characters.  Some mailers bounce
messages that are longer than this.  If your message is long, it is
generally better to send a message offering to make the large file
available to only those people who want it (e.g. mailing it to people
who ask, or putting it up for FTP).  In the case of gnu.emacs.sources,
somewhat larger postings (up to 10 parts of no more than 25,000
characters each) are acceptable (assuming they are likely to be of
interest to a reasonable number of people); if it is larger than that
have it added to archive.cis.ohio-state.edu (the GNU Emacs Lisp ftp and
uucp archive on and announce) its location there.  Good bug reports are
short.  See section '* General Information about bug-* lists and ...'
for further details.

Most of the time, when you reply to a message sent to a list, the reply
should not go to the list.  But most mail reading programs supply, by
default, all the recipients of the original as recipients of the reply.
Make a point of deleting the list address from the header when it does
not belong.  This prevents bothering all readers of a list, and reduces
network congestion.

The GNU mailing lists and newsgroups, like the GNU project itself, exist
to promote the freedom to share software.  So don't use these lists to
promote or recommend non-free software.  (Using them to post ordering
information is the ultimate faux pas.)  If there is no free program to
do a certain task, then somebody should write one!

* General Information about info-* lists

These lists and their newsgroups are meant for important announcements.
Since the GNU project uses software development as a means for social
change, the announcements may be technical or political.

Most GNU projects info-* lists (and their corresponding gnu.*.announce
newsgroups) are moderated to keep their content significant and
relevant.  If you have a bug to report, send it to the bug-* list.  If
you need help on something else and the help-* list exists, ask it.

See section '* General Information about all lists'.

* General Information about help-* lists

These lists (and their newsgroups) exist for anyone to ask questions
about the GNU software that the list deals with.  The lists are read by
people who are willing to take the time to help other users.

When you answer the questions that people ask on the help-* lists, keep
in mind that you shouldn't answer by promoting a proprietary program as
a solution.  The only real solutions are the ones all the readers can
share.

If a program crashes, or if you build it following the standard
procedure on a system on which it is supposed to work and it does not
work at all, or if an command does not behave as it is documented to
behave, this is a bug.  Don't send bug reports to a help-* list; mail
them to the bug-* list instead.

See section '* General Information about all lists'.

* General Information about bug-* lists and reporting program bugs

If you think something is a bug in a program, it might be one; or, it
might be a misunderstanding or even a feature.  Before beginning to
report bugs, please read the section ``Reporting Emacs Bugs'' toward the
end of the GNU Emacs reference manual (or node Emacs/Bugs in Emacs's
built-in Info system) for a discussion of how and when to send in bug
reports.  For GNU programs other than GNU Emacs, also consult their
documentation for their bug reporting procedures.  Always include the
version number of the GNU program, as well as the operating system and
machine the program was ran on (if the program doesn't have a version
number, send the date of the latest entry in the file ChangeLog).  For
GNU Emacs bugs, type "M-x emacs-version".  A debugger backtrace of any
core dump, can also be useful.  Be careful to separate out hypothesis
from fact!  For bugs in GNU Emacs lisp, set variable debug-on-error to
t, and re-enter the command(s) that cause the error message; Emacs will
pop up a debug buffer if something is wrong; please include a copy of
the buffer in your bug report.  Please also try to make your bug report
as short as possible; distill the problem to as few lines of code and/or
input as possible.  GNU maintainers give priority to the shortest, high
quality bug reports.

Please don't send in a patch without a test case to illustrate the
problem the patch is supposed to fix.  Sometimes the patches aren't
correct or aren't the best way to do the job, and without a test case
there is no way to debug an alternate fix.

The purpose of reporting a bug is to enable the bug to be fixed for the
sake of the whole community of users.  You may or may not receive a
response; the maintainers will send one if that helps them find or
verify a fix.  Most GNU maintainers are volunteers and all are
overworked; they don't have time to help individuals and still fix the
bugs and make the improvements that everyone wants.  If you want help
for yourself in particular, you may have to hire someone.  The GNU
project maintains a list of people providing such services.  It is
distributed with GNU Emacs in file etc/SERVICE, and can be requested
from gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.

Anything addressed to the implementors and maintainers of a GNU program
via a bug-* list, should NOT be sent to the corresponding info-* or
help-* list.

Please DON'T post your bug reports on the gnu.*.bug newsgroups!  Mail
them to bug-*@prep instead!  At first sight, it seems to make no
difference: anything sent to one will be propagated to the other; but:
	- if you post on the newsgroup, the information about how to
reach you is lost in the message that goes on the mailing list.  It
can be very important to know how to reach you, if there is anything
in the bug report that we don't understand;
	- bug reports reach the GNU maintainers quickest when they are
sent to the bug-* mailing list submittal address;
	- mail is much more reliable then netnews; and
	- if the internet mailers can't get your bug report delivered,
they almost always send you an error message, so you can find another
way to get the bug report in.  When netnews fails to get your message
delivered to the maintainers, you'll never know about it and the
maintainers will never see the bug report.

And please DON'T post your GNU bug reports to comp.* or other gnu.*
newsgroups, they never make it to the GNU maintainers at all.  Please
mail them to bug-*@prep instead!

See section '* General Information about all lists'.

* info-gnu-request@prep.ai.mit.edu to subscribe to info-gnu
** gnUSENET newsgroup: gnu.announce
** Send announcements to: info-gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu

This list distributes progress reports on the GNU Project.  It is also
used by the GNU Project to ask people for various kinds of help.  It is
NOT for general discussion.

The list is filtered to remove items meant for info-gnu-request, that
can be answered by the moderator without bothering the list, or should
have been sent to another list.

See section '* General Information about info-* lists'.

* gnu-misc-discuss-request@cis.ohio-state.edu to subscribe to gnu-misc-discuss
** gnUSENET newsgroup: gnu.misc.discuss
** Send contributions to: gnu-misc-discuss@cis.ohio-state.edu

This list is for serious discussion of freed software, the GNU
Project, the GNU Manifesto and their implications.  It's THE place for
discussion that is not appropriate in the other GNU mailing lists and
gnUSENET newsgroups.

Flaming is out of place.  Tit-for-tat is not welcome.  Repetition
should not occur.

Good READING and writing are expected.  Before posting, wait a while,
cool off, and think.

Don't use this group for complaints about GNU software!
The maintainers don't read this group; they won't see your complaint.
Use the appropriate bug-reporting mailing list instead, so that people
who can do something about the problem will see it.

Don't trust pronouncements made on gnu-misc-discuss about what GNU is,
what FSF position is, what the GNU General Public License is, etc.,
unless they are made by someone you know is well connected with GNU and
are sure the message is not forged.

USENET and gnUSENET readers are expected to have read ALL the articles
in news.announce.newusers before posting.  If news.announce.newusers is
empty at your site, wait (the articles are posted monthly), your posting
isn't that urgent!  Readers on the Internet can anonymous ftp these
articles from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil under directory
PD2:<UNIX-C.USENET>.

Someone from the Free Software Foundation will attempt to follow this
group as time and volume permits.

Remember, "GNUs Not Unix" and "gnUSENET is Not USENET".  We have
higher standards!

Note that sending technical questions about specific GNU software to
gnu-misc-discuss is likely to be less useful than sending them to the
appropriate mailing list or gnUSENET newsgroup, since more technical
people read those.

* hurd-ann-request@prep.ai.mit.edu to subscribe to hurd-ann
** gnUSENET newsgroup: gnu.hurd.announce
** Send announcements to: hurd-ann@prep.ai.mit.edu

This list distributes progress reports on the GNU Hurd.  It is also to
ask people for various kinds of help on the Hurd.  It is NOT for general
discussion.

The list is filtered to remove items meant for hurd-ann-request, that
can be answered by the moderator without bothering the list, or should
have been sent to another list.

See section '* General Information about info-* lists'.

* bug-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu to subscribe to bug-gnu-emacs
** gnUSENET newsgroup: gnu.emacs.bug
** Gnu Emacs bug reports to: bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu

This list distributes, to the active maintainers of GNU Emacs, bug
reports and fixes for, and suggestions for improvements in GNU Emacs.

Send bugs in the GNU Emacs Lisp reference manual to:
	lisp-manual-bugs@prep.ai.mit.edu

lisp-manual-bugs is neither a mailing list nor a gnUSENET newsgroup.
It's just a bug-reporting address.

Subscribers to bug-gnu-emacs get all info-gnu-emacs messages.

See section '* General Information about bug-* lists and reporting
program bugs'.

* gnu-emacs-sources-request@prep.ai.mit.edu to subscribe to gnu-emacs-sources
** gnUSENET newsgroup: gnu.emacs.sources
** Gnu Emacs source code to: gnu-emacs-sources@prep.ai.mit.edu

This list/newsgroup will be for the posting, by their authors, of lisp
and C sources and patches that improve GNU Emacs.  Its contents will
be reviewed by FSF for inclusion in future releases of GNU Emacs.

Please do NOT discuss or request source code here.  Use
help-gnu-emacs/gnu.emacs.help for those purposes.  This allows the
automatic archiving of sources posted to this list/newsgroup.

Please do NOT post such sources to any other GNU mailing list (e.g
help-gnu-emacs) or gnUSENET newsgroups (e.g. gnu.emacs.help).  It's up
to each poster to decide whether to cross-post to any non-gnUSENET
newsgroup (e.g. comp.emacs or vmsnet.sources).

Please do NOT announce that you have posted source code to
gnu.emacs.sources to any other GNU mailing list (e.g. help-gnu-emacs) or
gnUSENET newsgroups (e.g. gnu.emacs.help).  People who want to keep up
with sources will read this list/newsgroup.  It's up to each poster to
decide whether to announce a gnu.emacs.sources article in any
non-gnUSENET newsgroup (e.g comp.emacs or comp.sources.d).

If source or patches that were previously posted or a simple fix is
requested in help-gnu-emacs, please mail it to the requester.  Do NOT
repost it.  If you also want something that is requested, send mail to
the requester asking him to forward it to you.  This kind of traffic is
best handled by e-mail, not by a broadcast medium that reaches thousands
of sites.

If the source is very long (>10k bytes) send mail offering to send it.
This prevents the requester from getting many redundant copies and saves
network bandwidth.

* help-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu to subscribe to help-gnu-emacs
** gnUSENET newsgroup: gnu.emacs.help	(and one-way into comp.emacs)
** Send contributions to: help-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu

This list is the place for users and installers of GNU Emacs to ask for
help.  Please send bug reports to bug-gnu-emacs instead of posting them
here.

Since help-gnu-emacs is a very large list, send it only those items that
are seriously important to many people.

If source or patches that were previously posted or a simple fix is
requested in help-gnu-emacs, please mail it to the requester.  Do NOT
repost it.  If you also want something that is requested, send mail to
the requester asking him to forward it to you.  This kind of traffic is
best handled by e-mail, not a broadcast medium that reaches thousands of
sites.

This list is also gated one way to USENET's newsgroup comp.emacs (once
known as net.emacs).  This one-way gating is done for users whose sites
get comp.emacs, but not gnu.emacs.help.  Users at non-USENET sites may
receive all articles from comp.emacs by making their request to:
unix-emacs-request@bbn.com

If Emacs crashes, or if you build Emacs following the standard procedure
on a system which Emacs is supposed to work on (see etc/MACHINES) and it
does not work at all, or if an editing command does not behave as it is
documented to behave, this is a bug.  Don't send bug reports to
help-gnu-emacs (gnu.emacs.help) or post them to comp.emacs; mail them to
bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu instead.

See section '* General Information about help-* lists'.

* info-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu to subscribe to info-gnu-emacs
** gnUSENET newsgroup: gnu.emacs.announce	(and one-way into comp.emacs)
** Send announcements to: info-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu

It is NOT for general discussion; please use help-gnu-emacs for that.

The list is filtered to remove items meant for info-gnu-emacs-request,
that can be answered by the moderator without bothering the list, or
should have been sent to another list.

info-gnu-emacs is also gated one way to USENET's newsgroup comp.emacs
(once known as net.emacs).  This one-way gating is done for users whose
sites get comp.emacs, but not gnu.emacs.announce.  Users at non-USENET
sites may receive all articles from comp.emacs by making their request
to: unix-emacs-request@bbn.com

Do not report GNU Emacs bugs to info-gnu-emacs or comp.emacs, instead
mail them to bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu.

See section '* General Information about info-* lists'.

* vms-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu to subscribe
** gnUSENET newsgroup: gnu.emacs.vms
** Send contributions to: vms-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu

This list was a working group who did the initial port of GNU Emacs to
the VMS operating system.  It still discusses problems and solutions to
the VMS port and the distribution of it.

* bug-bash-request@prep.ai.mit.edu to subscribe to bug-bash
** gnUSENET newsgroup: gnu.bash.bug
** BASH bug reports to: bug-bash@prep.ai.mit.edu

Again SHell), bug reports and fixes for, and suggestions for
improvements in BASH.  User discussion of BASH also occurs here.

Always report the version number of the operating system, hardware, and
bash (flag -version on startup or check the variable $BASH_VERSION in a
running bash).

There are no other GNU mailing lists or gnUSENET newsgroups for BASH.

** GCC bug reports to: bug-gcc@prep.ai.mit.edu

This list distributes bug reports for, fixes for bugs in, and
suggestions for improvements in the GNU C Compiler to its active
developers.

Please don't send in a patch without a test case to illustrate the
problem the patch is supposed to fix.  Sometimes the patches aren't
correct or aren't the best way to do the job, and without a test case
there is no way to debug an alternate fix.

The most convenient form of test case is a piece of cpp output that can
be passed directly to cc1.  Preferably written in C, not C++ or
Objective C.

Subscribers to bug-gcc get all info-gcc messages.

See section '* General Information about bug-* lists and reporting
program bugs'.

If gcc crashes, or if you build gcc following the standard procedure on
a system which gcc is supposed to work on (see config.sub) and it does
not work at all, or if an command line option does not behave as it is
documented to behave, this is a bug.  Don't send bug reports to help-gcc
(gnu.gcc.help); mail them to bug-gcc@prep.ai.mit.edu instead.

Shogi is a game something like chess.  There are several different types
of pieces, a board that is 9 by 9 squares, and the modification that a
captured piece can be reintroduced on the board by the capturing player
(and used).  Due to this last difference from Western chess, a Shogi
game never simplifies.
