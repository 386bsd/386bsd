;;; Gomoku game between you and GNU Emacs.  Last modified on 13 Sep 1988
;;;
;;; Written by Ph. Schnoebelen (phs@lifia.imag.fr), 1987, 1988
;;; with precious advices from J.-F. Rit.
;;; This has been tested with GNU Emacs 18.50.

;; RULES:
;;
;; Gomoku is a game played between two players on a rectangular board.	Each
;; player, in turn, marks a free square of its choice. The winner is the first
;; one to mark five contiguous squares in any direction (horizontally,
;; vertically or diagonally).
;;
;; I have been told that, in "The TRUE Gomoku", some restrictions are made
;; about the squares where one may play, or else there is a known forced win
;; for the first player. This program has no such restriction, but it does not
;; know about the forced win, nor do I.	 Furthermore, you probably do not know
;; it yourself :-).


;; There are two main places where you may want to customize the program: key
;; bindings and board display. These features are commented in the code. Go
;; and see.


;; HOW TO USE:
;;
;; The command "M-x gomoku" displays a
;; board, the size of which depends on the size of the current window. The
;; size of the board is easily modified by giving numeric arguments to the
;; gomoku command and/or by customizing the displaying parameters.
;;
;; Emacs plays when it is its turn. When it is your turn, just put the cursor
;; on the square where you want to play and hit RET, or X, or whatever key you
;; bind to the command gomoku-human-plays. When it is your turn, Emacs is
;; idle: you may switch buffers, read your mail, ... Just come back to the
;; *Gomoku* buffer and resume play.


;; ALGORITHM:
;;
;; The algorithm is briefly described in section "THE SCORE TABLE". Some
;; parameters may be modified if you want to change the style exhibited by the
;; program.

;; detect when we are trying to move out of the board.	We denote a square by
;; its (X,Y) coords, or by the INDEX corresponding to them in the vector.  The
;; leftmost topmost square has coords (1,1) and index gomoku-board-width + 2.
;; Similarly, vectors between squares may be given by two DX, DY coords or by
;; one DEPL (the difference between indexes).

;;;
;;; THE SCORE TABLE.
;;;

;; Every (free) square has a score associated to it, recorded in the
;; GOMOKU-SCORE-TABLE vector. The program always plays in the square having
;; the highest score.

(defvar gomoku-score-table nil
  "Vector recording the actual score of the free squares.")


;; The key point point about the algorithm is that, rather than considering
;; the board as just a set of squares, we prefer to see it as a "space" of
;; internested 5-tuples of contiguous squares (called qtuples).
;;
;; The aim of the program is to fill one qtuple with its O's while preventing
;; you from filling another one with your X's. To that effect, it computes a
;; score for every qtuple, with better qtuples having better scores. Of
;; course, the score of a qtuple (taken in isolation) is just determined by
;; its contents as a set, i.e. not considering the order of its elements. The
;; highest score is given to the "OOOO" qtuples because playing in such a
;; qtuple is winning the game. Just after this comes the "XXXX" qtuple because
;; not playing in it is just loosing the game, and so on. Note that a
;; "polluted" qtuple, i.e. one containing at least one X and at least one O,
;; has score zero because there is no more any point in playing in it, from
;; both an attacking and a defending point of view.
;;
;; Given the score of every qtuple, the score of a given free square on the
;; board is just the sum of the scores of all the qtuples to which it belongs,
;; because playing in that square is playing in all its containing qtuples at
;; once. And it is that function which takes into account the internesting of
;; the qtuples.
;;
;; This algorithm is rather simple but anyway it gives a not so dumb level of
;; play. It easily extends to "n-dimensional Gomoku", where a win should not
;; be obtained with as few as 5 contiguous marks: 6 or 7 (depending on n !)
;; should be preferred.


;; Here are the scores of the nine "non-polluted" configurations.  Tuning
;; these values will change (hopefully improve) the strength of the program
;; and may change its style (rather aggressive here).

(defconst nil-score	  7  "Score of an empty qtuple.")
(defconst Xscore	 15  "Score of a qtuple containing one X.")
(defconst XXscore	400  "Score of a qtuple containing two X's.")
(defconst XXXscore     1800  "Score of a qtuple containing three X's.")
(defconst XXXXscore  100000  "Score of a qtuple containing four X's.")
(defconst Oscore	 35  "Score of a qtuple containing one O.")
(defconst OOscore	800  "Score of a qtuple containing two O's.")
(defconst OOOscore    15000  "Score of a qtuple containing three O's.")
(defconst OOOOscore  800000  "Score of a qtuple containing four O's.")

;; These values are not just random: if, given the following situation:
;;
;;			  . . . . . . . O .
;;			  . X X a . . . X .
;;			  . . . X . . . X .
;;			  . . . X . . . X .
;;			  . . . . . . . b .
;;
;; you want Emacs to play in "a" and not in "b", then the parameters must
;; satisfy the inequality:
;;
;;		   6 * XXscore > XXXscore + XXscore
;;
;; because "a" mainly belongs to six "XX" qtuples (the others are less
;; important) while "b" belongs to one "XXX" and one "XX" qtuples.  Other
;; conditions are required to obtain sensible moves, but the previous example
;; should illustrate the point. If you manage to improve on these values,
;; please send me a note. Thanks.


;; As we choosed values 0, 1 and 6 to denote empty, X and O squares, the
;; contents of a qtuple is uniquely determined by the sum of its elements and
;; we just have to set up a translation table.

(defconst gomoku-score-trans-table
  (vector nil-score Xscore XXscore XXXscore XXXXscore 0

;; If you do not modify drastically the previous constants, the only way for a
;; square to have a score higher than OOOOscore is to belong to a "OOOO"
;; qtuple, thus to be a winning move. Similarly, the only way for a square to
;; have a score between XXXXscore and OOOOscore is to belong to a "XXXX"

;; consuming, we initialize every square with 20*nil-score and then only
;; consider squares at less than 5 squares from one side. We speed this up by
;; taking symmetry into account.
;; Also, as it is likely that successive games will be played on a board with
