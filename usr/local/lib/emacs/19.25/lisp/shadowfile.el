;;; Helps you keep identical copies of files in multiple places.|
;;; $Date: 1994/05/03 22:57:18 $ |$Revision: 1.3 $|~/misc/shadowfile.el.Z|

;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;;  This package helps you to keep identical copies of files in more than one
;;;  place - possibly on different machines.  When you save a file, it checks
;;;  whether it is on the list of files with "shadows", and if so, it tries to
;;;  copy it when you exit emacs (or use the shadow-copy-files command).

;;; Installation & Use:
;;;
;;;      Put (require 'shadowfile) in your .emacs; add clusters (if necessary)
;;;  and file groups with shadow-define-cluster, shadow-define-literal-group,
;;;  and shadow-define-regexp-group (see the documentation for these functions
;;;  for information on how and when to use them).  After doing this once,
;;;  everything should be automatic.
;;;      The lists of clusters and shadows are saved in a file called
;;;  .shadows, so that they can be remembered from one emacs session to
;;;  another, even (as much as possible) if the emacs session terminates
;;;  abnormally.  The files needing to be copied are stored in .shadow_todo; if
;;;  a file cannot be copied for any reason, it will stay on the list to be
;;;  tried again next time.  The .shadows file should itself have shadows on
;;;  all your accounts so that the information in it is consistent everywhere,
;;;  but .shadow_todo is local information and should have no shadows.
;;;     If you do not want to copy a particular file, you can answer "no"
;;;  and be asked again next time you hit C-x 4 s or exit emacs.  If you do not
;;;  want to be asked again, use shadow-cancel, and you will not be asked until
;;;  you change the file and save it again.  If you do not want to shadow
;;;  that file ever again, you can edit it out of the .shadows buffer.
;;;  Anytime you edit the .shadows buffer, you must type M-x shadow-read-files
;;;  to load in the new information, or your changes will be overwritten!

;;; Bugs & Warnings:
;;;
;;;  - It is bad to have two emacses both running shadowfile at the same
;;;  time.  It tries to detect this condition, but is not always successful.
;;;
;;;  - You have to be careful not to edit a file in two locations
;;;  before shadowfile has had a chance to copy it; otherwise
;;;  "updating shadows" will overwrite one of the changed versions.
;;;
;;;  - It ought to check modification times of both files to make sure
;;;  it is doing the right thing.  This will have to wait until
;;;  file-newer-than-file-p works between machines.
;;;
;;;  - It will not make directories for you, it just fails to copy files
;;;  that belong in non-existent directories.
;;;
;;;  Please report any bugs to me (boris@cs.rochester.edu).  Also let me know
;;;  if you have suggestions or would like to be informed of updates.
