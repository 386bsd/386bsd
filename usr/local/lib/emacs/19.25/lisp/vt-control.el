;;; Commentary:

;;  The functions contained in this file send various VT control codes
;;  to the terminal where emacs is running.  The following functions are
;;  available.

;;    Function           Action

;;    vt-wide            set wide screen (132 characters)
;;    vt-narrow          set narrow screen (80 characters)
;;    vt-toggle-screen   toggle wide/narrow screen
;;    vt-keypad-on       set applications keypad on
;;    vt-keypad-off      set applications keypad off
;;    vt-numlock         toggle applications keypad on/off

;;; Usage:

;;  To use enable these functions, simply load this file.

;;  Note: vt-control makes no effort to determine how the terminal is
;;        initially set.  It assumes the terminal starts with a width
;;        of 80 characters and the applications keypad enabled.  Nor
;;        does vt-control try to restore the terminal when emacs is
;;        killed or suspended.
