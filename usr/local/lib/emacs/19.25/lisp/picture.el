;;; Commentary:

;; This code provides the picture-mode commands documented in the Emacs 
;; manual.  The screen is treated as a semi-infinite quarter-plane with
;; support for rectangle operations and `etch-a-sketch' character
;; insertion in any of eight directions.

It defines a set of \"interesting characters\" to look for when setting
\(or searching for) tab stops, initially \"!-~\" (all printing characters).
For example, suppose that you are editing a table which is formatted thus:
| foo		| bar + baz | 23  *
| bubbles	| and + etc | 97  *

Another example - \"A-Za-z0-9\" would produce the tab stops

Note that if you want the character `-' to be in the set, it must be
included in a range or else appear in a context where it cannot be
taken for indicating a range (e.g. \"-A-Z\" declares the set to be the
letters `A' through `Z' and the character `-').  If you want the

The current direction is displayed in the mode line.  The initial
direction is right.  Whitespace is inserted and tabs are changed to
spaces when required by movement.  You can move around in the buffer
with these commands:
  \\[picture-move-down]	  Move vertically to SAME column in previous line.
  \\[picture-move-up]	  Move vertically to SAME column in next line.
  \\[picture-end-of-line]	  Move to column following last non-whitespace character.

  C-c C-f Move in direction of current picture motion.
  C-c C-b Move in opposite direction of current picture motion.

You can edit tabular text with these commands:

	    `Indents' relative to a previous line.
  Tab	  Move to next stop in tab stop list.
  C-c Tab Set tab stops according to context of this line.

	    See also documentation of variable	picture-tab-chars
	    which defines \"interesting character\".  You can manually
	    change the tab stop list with command \\[edit-tab-stops].
You can manipulate text with these commands:
  C-d	  Clear (replace) ARG columns after point without moving.
  C-c C-d Delete char at point - the command normally assigned to C-d.
  \\[picture-backward-clear-column]  Clear (replace) ARG columns before point, moving back over them.
  \\[picture-clear-line]	  Clear ARG lines, advancing over them.	 The cleared
	    text is saved in the kill ring.
  \\[picture-open-line]	  Open blank line(s) beneath current line.
You can manipulate rectangles with these commands:
  C-c C-k Clear (or kill) a rectangle and save it.
  C-c C-w Like C-c C-k except rectangle is saved in named register.
  C-c C-y Overlay (or insert) currently saved rectangle at point.
  C-c C-x Like C-c C-y except rectangle is taken from named register.
  \\[copy-rectangle-to-register]   Copies a rectangle to a register.
  \\[advertised-undo]   Can undo effects of rectangle overlay commands
	    commands if invoked soon enough.
