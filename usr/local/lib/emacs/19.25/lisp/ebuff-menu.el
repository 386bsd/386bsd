;;; Commentary:

;; Who says one can't have typeout windows in GNU Emacs?   The entry
;; point, `electric-buffer-list' works like ^r select buffer from the
;; ITS Emacs lunar or tmacs libraries.

;;; Code:

(require 'electric)

;; this depends on the format of list-buffers (from src/buffer.c) and
;; on stuff in lisp/buff-menu.el

(defun electric-buffer-list (arg)
  "Pops up a buffer describing the set of Emacs buffers.
Vaguely like ITS lunar select buffer; combining typeoutoid buffer
listing with menuoid buffer selection.

If the very next character typed is a space then the buffer list
window disappears.  Otherwise, one may move around in the buffer list
window, marking buffers to be selected, saved or deleted.

To exit and select a new buffer, type a space when the cursor is on
the appropriate line of the buffer-list window.  Other commands are
much like those of buffer-menu-mode.

Calls value of `electric-buffer-menu-mode-hook' on entry if non-nil.
