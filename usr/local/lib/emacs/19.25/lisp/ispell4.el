;;;; ispell-complete-word

;;; Brief Description:
;;; Complete word fragment at point using dictionary and replace with full
;;; word.  Expansion done in current buffer like lisp-complete-symbol.
;;; Completion of interior word fragments possible with prefix argument.

;;; Known Problem: 
;;; Does not use private dictionary because GNU `look' does not use it.  It
;;; would be nice if GNU `look' took standard input; this would allow gzip'ed
;;; dictionaries to be used.  GNU `look' also has a bug, see
;;; `ispell-gnu-look-still-broken-p'.

;;; Motivation: 
;;; The `l', "regular expression look up", keymap option of ispell-word
;;; (ispell-do-look) can only be run after finding a misspelled word.  So
;;; ispell-do-look can not be used to look for words starting with `cat' to
;;; find `catechetical' since `cat' is a correctly spelled word.  Furthermore,
;;; ispell-do-look does not return the entire list returned by `look'.
;;;  
;;; ispell-complete-word allows you to get a completion list from the system
;;; dictionary and expand a word fragment at the current position in a buffer.
;;; These examples assume ispell-complete-word is bound to M-TAB as it is in
;;; text-mode; the `Complete Word' and `Complete Interior Fragment' entries of
;;; the "Spell" submenu under the "Edit" menu may also be used instead of
;;; M-TAB and C-u M-TAB, respectively.
;;;
;;;   EXAMPLE 1: The word `Saskatchewan' needs to be spelled.  The user may
;;;   type `Sas' and hit M-TAB and a completion list will be built using the
;;;   shell command `look' and displayed in the *Completions* buffer:
;;;
;;;        Possible completions are:
;;;        sash                               sashay
;;;        sashayed                           sashed
;;;        sashes                             sashimi
;;;        Saskatchewan                       Saskatoon
;;;        sass                               sassafras
;;;        sassier                            sassing
;;;        sasswood                           sassy
;;;
;;;   By viewing this list the user will hopefully be motivated to insert the
;;;   letter `k' after the `sas'.  When M-TAB is hit again the word `Saskat'
;;;   will be inserted in place of `sas' (note case) since this is a unique
;;;   substring completion.  The narrowed completion list can be viewed with
;;;   another M-TAB
;;;
;;;        Possible completions are:
;;;        Saskatchewan                       Saskatoon
;;;
;;;   Inserting the letter `c' and hitting M-TAB will narrow the completion
;;;   possibilities to just `Saskatchewan' and this will be inserted in the
;;;   buffer.  At any point the user may click the mouse on a completion to
;;;   select it.
;;;
;;;   EXAMPLE 2: The user has typed `Sasaquane' and M-$ (ispell-word) gives no
;;;   "near-misses" in which case you back up to `Sas' and hit M-TAB and find
;;;   the correct word as above.  The `Sas' will be replaced by `Saskatchewan'
;;;   and the remaining word fragment `aquane' can be deleted.
;;;
;;;   EXAMPLE 3: If a version of `look' is used that supports regular
;;;   expressions, then `ispell-have-new-look' should be t (its default) and
;;;   interior word fragments may also be used for the search.  The word
;;;   `pneumonia' needs to be spelled.  The user can only remember the
;;;   interior fragment `mon' in which case `C-u M-TAB' on `mon' gives a list
;;;   of all words containing the interior word fragment `mon'.  Typing `p'
;;;   and M-TAB will narrow this list to all the words starting with `p' and
;;;   containing `mon' from which `pneumonia' can be found as above.

;;; The user-defined variables are:
;;;
;;;  ispell-look-command
;;;  ispell-look-dictionary
;;;  ispell-gnu-look-still-broken-p

;;; Algorithm (some similarity to lisp-complete-symbol):
;;;  
;;; * call-process on command ispell-look-command (default: "look") to find
;;;   words in ispell-look-dictionary matching `string' (or `regexp' if 
;;;   ispell-have-new-look is t).  Parse output and store results in 
;;;   ispell-lookup-completions-alist.
;;; 
;;; * Build completion list using try-completion and `string'
;;; 
;;; * Replace `string' in buffer with matched common substring completion.
;;; 
;;; * Display completion list only if there is no matched common substring.
;;; 
;;; * Rebuild ispell-lookup-completions-alist, on a next call, only when
;;;   beginning of word fragment has changed.
;;;  
;;; * Interior fragments searches are performed similarly with the exception
;;;   that the entire fragment at point is initially removed from the buffer,
;;;   the STRING passed to try-completion and all-completions is just "" and
;;;   not the interior fragment; this allows all completions containing the
;;;   interior fragment to be shown.  The location in the buffer is stored to
;;;   decide whether future completion narrowing of the current list should be
;;;   done or if a new list should be built.  See interior fragment example
;;;   above.
;;;
;;; * Robust searches are done using a `look' with -r (regular expression) 
;;;   switch if ispell-have-new-look is t.

;;;; User-defined variables.
