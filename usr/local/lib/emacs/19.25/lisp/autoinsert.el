;;; Commentary:

;;;  Abstract:
;;;
;;;  The following defines an association list for files to be
;;;  automatically inserted when a new file is created, and a function
;;;  which automatically inserts these files; the idea is to insert
;;;  default files much as the mode is automatically set using
;;;  auto-mode-alist.
;;;
;;;  The auto-insert-alist consists of dotted pairs of
;;;  ( REGEXP . FILENAME ) where REGEXP is a regular expression, and
;;;  FILENAME is the file name of a file which is to be inserted into
;;;  all new files matching the regular expression with which it is
;;;  paired.
;;;
;;;  To use: 
;;;     load autoinsert.el
;;;     setq auto-insert-directory to an appropriate value, which
;;;       must end in "/"

  "A list specifying text to insert by default into a new file.
Elements look like (REGEXP . FILENAME); if the new file's name
matches REGEXP, then the file FILENAME is inserted into the buffer.
Only the first matching element is effective.")

;;; Establish a default value for auto-insert-directory
(defvar auto-insert-directory "~/insert/"
  "*Directory from which auto-inserted files are taken.")

      (if (string-match (car (car alist)) name)
          (setq insert-file (cdr (car alist)))
        (setq alist (cdr alist))))

    ;; Now, if we found an appropriate insert file, insert it
    (if insert-file

		(set-buffer-modified-p nil))
            (message "Auto-insert: file %s not found" file)

;; Make this feature take effect when a nonexistent file is visited.

      (cons 'insert-auto-insert-files
	    find-file-not-found-hooks))
