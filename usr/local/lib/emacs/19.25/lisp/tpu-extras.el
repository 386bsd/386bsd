;;; Commentary:

;;  The functions contained in this file implement scroll margins and free
;;  cursor mode.  The following keys and commands are affected.

;;  These functions are not part of the base TPU-edt for the following
;;  reasons:

;;  Free cursor mode is implemented with the emacs picture-mode functions.
;;  These functions support moving the cursor all over the screen, however,
;;  when the cursor is moved past the end of a line, spaces or tabs are
;;  appended to the line - even if no text is entered in that area.  In
;;  order for a free cursor mode to work exactly like TPU/edt, this trailing
;;  whitespace needs to be dealt with in every function that might encounter
;;  it.  Such global changes are impractical, however, free cursor mode is
;;  too valuable to abandon completely, so it has been implemented in those
;;  functions where it serves best.

;;  The implementation of scroll margins adds overhead to previously
;;  simple and often used commands.  These commands are now responsible
;;  for their normal operation and part of the display function.  There
;;  is a possibility that this display overhead could adversely affect the
;;  performance of TPU-edt on slower computers.  In order to support the
;;  widest range of computers, scroll margin support is optional.

;;  I don't know for a fact that the overhead associated with scroll
;;  margin support is significant.  If you find that it is, please send me
;;  a note describing the extent of the performance degradation.  Be sure
;;  to include a description of the platform where you're running TPU-edt.
;;  Send your note to the address provided by Gold-V.

;;  Even with these differences and limitations, these functions implement
;;  important aspects of the real TPU/edt.  Those who miss free cursor mode
;;  and/or scroll margins will appreciate these implementations.

;;; Usage:

;;  To use this file, simply load it after loading TPU-edt.  After that,
;;  customize TPU-edt to your tastes by setting scroll margins and/or
;;  turning on free cursor mode.  Here's an example for your .emacs file.

;;     (load "tpu-edt")                      ; Load the base TPU-edt
;;     (load "tpu-extras")                   ;   and the extras.
;;     (tpu-set-scroll-margins "10%" "15%")  ; Set scroll margins.

;;  Once the extras are loaded, scroll margins and cursor binding can be
;;  changed with the following commands:

;;     tpu-set-scroll-margins  or   set scroll margins
;;     tpu-set-cursor-bound    or   set cursor bound
;;     tpu-set-cursor-free     or   set cursor free

;;  Additionally, Gold-F toggles between bound and free cursor modes.

;;  Note that switching out of free cursor mode or exiting TPU-edt while in
;;  free cursor mode strips trailing whitespace from every line in the file.
