;;; Commentary:

;; Extension commands for keyboard macros.  These permit you to assign
;; a name to the last-defined keyboard macro, expand and insert the
;; lisp corresponding to a macro, query the user from within a macro,
;; or apply a macro to each line in the reason.

;;; Code:

This Lisp code will, when executed, define the kbd macro with the same
definition it has now.  If you say to record the keys, the Lisp code
will also rebind those keys to the macro.  Only global key bindings
are recorded since executing this Lisp code always makes global
bindings.

To save a kbd macro, visit a file of Lisp code such as your `~/.emacs',
use this command, and then save the file."

(defun apply-macro-to-region-lines (top bottom &optional macro)
  "For each complete line between point and mark, move to the beginning
of the line, and run the last keyboard macro.

When called from lisp, this function takes two arguments TOP and
BOTTOM, describing the current region.  TOP must be before BOTTOM.
The optional third argument MACRO specifies a keyboard macro to
execute.

This is useful for quoting or unquoting included text, adding and
removing comments, or producing tables where the entries are regular.

For example, in Usenet articles, sections of text quoted from another
author are indented, or have each line start with `>'.  To quote a
section of text, define a keyboard macro which inserts `>', put point
and mark at opposite ends of the quoted section, and use
`\\[apply-macro-to-region-lines]' to mark the entire section.

Suppose you wanted to build a keyword table in C where each entry
looked like this:

    { \"foo\", foo_data, foo_function }, 
    { \"bar\", bar_data, bar_function },
    { \"baz\", baz_data, baz_function },

You could enter the names in this format:

    foo
    bar
    baz

and write a macro to massage a word into a table entry:

    \\C-x (
       \\M-d { \"\\C-y\", \\C-y_data, \\C-y_function },
    \\C-x )

and then select the region of un-tablified names and use
`\\[apply-macro-to-region-lines]' to build the table from the names.
