;;; Commentary:

;;; Produce in unsafe-list the set of all functions that may invoke GC.
;;; This expects the Emacs sources to live in emacs-source-directory.
;;; It creates a temporary working directory /tmp/esrc.

;;; Code:

(defun find-gc-unsafe ()
  (trace-call-tree nil)
  (trace-use-tree)
  (find-unsafe-funcs 'Fgarbage_collect)
  (setq unsafe-list (sort unsafe-list
			  (function (lambda (x y)
				      (string-lessp (car x) (car y))))))
)

;;; This does a depth-first search to find all functions that can
;;; ultimately call the function "target".  The result is an a-list
;;; in unsafe-list; the cars are the unsafe functions, and the cdrs
;;; are (one of) the unsafe functions that these functions directly
;;; call.
