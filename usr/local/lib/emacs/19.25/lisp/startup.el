Inhibition takes effect only if your `.emacs' file contains

the startup message unless he personally acts to inhibit it.")

Emacs loads the user's initialization file.")

The call is not protected by a condition-case, so you can set `debug-on-error'

the null string, meaning that the init file was taken from the user that
originally logged in, or it may be a string containing a user's name.
