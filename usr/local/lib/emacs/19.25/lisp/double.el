;;; Commentary:

;; This mode is intended for use with languages that adds a small
;; number of extra letters not available on the keyboard.
;; 
;; Examples includes Scandinavian and German with an US keyboard.
;;
;; The idea is that certain keys are overloaded.  When you press it
;; once it will insert one string, and when you press it twice the
;; string will be replaced by another.  This can be used for mapping
;; keys on a US keyboard to generate characters according to the local
;; keyboard convention when pressed once, and according to US keyboard
;; convetion when pressed twice. 
;;
;; To use this mode, you must define the variable `double-map' and
;; then enable double mode with `M-x double-mode'.  Read the
;; documentation for both of them.
;;
;; The default mapping is for getting Danish/Norwegian keyboard layout
;; using ISO Latin 1 on a US keyboard.
;;
;; Requires FSF Emacs 19.20 or later.
;;
;; Imprtant node: While I would like to hear comments, bug reports,
;; suggestions, please do @strong{not} expect me to put other mappings
;; that the default into this file.  There are billions and billions
;; of such mappings, and just supporting the most common would
;; increase the size of this nice small file manyfold.
