;;; Commentary:

;; To enter perl-mode automatically, add (autoload 'perl-mode "perl-mode")
;; to your .emacs file and change the first line of your perl script to:
;; #!/usr/bin/perl --	 # -*-Perl-*-
;; With argments to perl:
;; #!/usr/bin/perl -P-	 # -*-Perl-*-
;; To handle files included with do 'filename.pl';, add something like
;; (setq auto-mode-alist (append (list (cons "\\.pl$" 'perl-mode))
;;                               auto-mode-alist))
;; to your .emacs file; otherwise the .pl suffix defaults to prolog-mode.

;; This code is based on the 18.53 version c-mode.el, with extensive
;; rewriting.  Most of the features of c-mode survived intact.

;; I added a new feature which adds functionality to TAB; it is controlled
;; by the variable perl-tab-to-comment.  With it enabled, TAB does the
;; first thing it can from the following list:  change the indentation;
;; move past leading white space; delete an empty comment; reindent a
;; comment; move to end of line; create an empty comment; tell you that
;; the line ends in a quoted string, or has a # which should be a \#.

;; If your machine is slow, you may want to remove some of the bindings
;; to electric-perl-terminator.  I changed the indenting defaults to be
;; what Larry Wall uses in perl/lib, but left in all the options.

;; I also tuned a few things:  comments and labels starting in column
;; zero are left there by indent-perl-exp; perl-beginning-of-function
;; goes back to the first open brace/paren in column zero, the open brace
;; in 'sub ... {', or the equal sign in 'format ... ='; indent-perl-exp
;; (meta-^q) indents from the current line through the close of the next
;; brace/paren, so you don't need to start exactly at a brace or paren.

;; It may be good style to put a set of redundant braces around your
;; main program.  This will let you reindent it with meta-^q.

;; Known problems (these are all caused by limitations in the Emacs Lisp
;; parsing routine (parse-partial-sexp), which was not designed for such
;; a rich language; writing a more suitable parser would be a big job):
;; 1)  Regular expression delimiters do not act as quotes, so special
;;       characters such as `'"#:;[](){} may need to be backslashed
;;       in regular expressions and in both parts of s/// and tr///.
;; 2)  The globbing syntax <pattern> is not recognized, so special
;;       characters in the pattern string must be backslashed.
;; 3)  The q, qq, and << quoting operators are not recognized; see below.
;; 4)  \ (backslash) always quotes the next character, so '\' is
;;       treated as the start of a string.  Use "\\" as a work-around.
;; 5)  To make variables such a $' and $#array work, perl-mode treats
;;       $ just like backslash, so '$' is the same as problem 5.
;; 6)  Unfortunately, treating $ like \ makes ${var} be treated as an
;;       unmatched }.  See below.
;; 7)  When ' (quote) is used as a package name separator, perl-mode
;;       doesn't understand, and thinks it is seeing a quoted string.

;; Here are some ugly tricks to bypass some of these problems:  the perl
;; expression /`/ (that's a back-tick) usually evaluates harmlessly,
;; but will trick perl-mode into starting a quoted string, which
;; can be ended with another /`/.  Assuming you have no embedded
;; back-ticks, this can used to help solve problem 3:
;;
;;     /`/; $ugly = q?"'$?; /`/;
;;
;; To solve problem 6, add a /{/; before each use of ${var}:
;;     /{/; while (<${glob_me}>) ...
;;
;; Problem 7 is even worse, but this 'fix' does work :-(

Variables controlling indentation style:
 perl-tab-always-indent
    Non-nil means TAB in Perl mode should always indent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 perl-tab-to-comment
    Non-nil means that for lines which don't need indenting, TAB will
    either delete an empty comment, indent an existing comment, move 
    to end-of-line, or if at end-of-line already, create a new comment.
 perl-nochange
    Lines starting with this regular expression are not auto-indented.
 perl-indent-level
    Indentation of Perl statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 perl-continued-statement-offset
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if or body of a while.
 perl-continued-brace-offset
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `perl-continued-statement-offset'.
 perl-brace-offset
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 perl-brace-imaginary-offset
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were
    this far to the right of the start of its line.
 perl-label-offset
    Extra indentation for line that is a label.

Various indentation styles:       K&R  BSD  BLK  GNU  LW
  perl-indent-level                5    8    0    2    4
  perl-continued-statement-offset  5    8    4    2    4
  perl-continued-brace-offset      0    0    0    0   -4
