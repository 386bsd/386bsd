;;; Commentary:

;; This minor mode adds some services to Emacs-Lisp editing mode.
;;
;; First, it knows about the header conventions for library packages.
;; One entry point supports generating synopses from a library directory.
;; Another can be used to check for missing headers in library files.
;; 
;; Another entry point automatically addresses bug mail to a package's
;; maintainer or author.

;; This file can be loaded by your lisp-mode-hook.  Have it (require 'lisp-mnt)

;; This file is an example of the header conventions.  Note the following
;; features:
;; 
;;    * Header line --- makes it possible to extract a one-line summary of
;; the package's uses automatically for use in library synopses, KWIC
;; indexes and the like.
;; 
;;    Format is three semicolons, followed by the filename, followed by
;; three dashes, followed by the summary.  All fields space-separated.
;; 
;;    * Author line --- contains the name and net address of at least
;; the principal author.
;; 
;;    If there are multiple authors, they should be listed on continuation
;; lines led by ;;<TAB>, like this:
;; 
;; ;; Author: Ashwin Ram <Ram-Ashwin@cs.yale.edu>
;; ;;	Dave Sill <de5@ornl.gov>
;; ;;	David Lawrence <tale@pawl.rpi.edu>
;; ;;	Noah Friedman <friedman@ai.mit.edu>
;; ;;	Joe Wells <jbw@maverick.uswest.com>
;; ;;	Dave Brennan <brennan@hal.com>
;; ;;	Eric Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>
;; 
;; This field may have some special values; notably "FSF", meaning
;; "Free Software Foundation".
;; 
;;    * Maintainer line --- should be a single name/address as in the Author
;; line, or an address only, or the string "FSF".  If there is no maintainer
;; line, the person(s) in the Author field are presumed to be it.  The example
;; in this file is mildly bogus because the maintainer line is redundant.
;;    The idea behind these two fields is to be able to write a lisp function
;; that does "send mail to the author" without having to mine the name out by
;; hand. Please be careful about surrounding the network address with <> if
;; there's also a name in the field.
;; 
;;    * Created line --- optional, gives the original creation date of the
;; file.  For historical interest, basically.
;; 
;;    * Version line --- intended to give the reader a clue if they're looking
;; at a different version of the file than the one they're accustomed to.  This
;; may be an RCS or SCCS header.
;; 
;;    * Adapted-By line --- this is for FSF's internal use.  The person named
;; in this field was the one responsible for installing and adapting the
;; package for the distribution.  (This file doesn't have one because the
;; author *is* one of the maintainers.)
;; 
;;    * Keywords line --- used by the finder code (now under construction)
;; for finding elisp code related to a topic.
;;
;;    * X-Bogus-Bureaucratic-Cruft line --- this is a joke and an example
;; of a comment header.  Headers starting with `X-' should never be used
;; for any real purpose; this is the way to safely add random headers
;; without invoking the wrath of any program.
;;
;;    * Commentary line --- enables lisp code to find the developer's and
;; maintainers' explanations of the package internals.
;; 
;;    * Change log line --- optional, exists to terminate the commentary
;; section and start a change-log part, if one exists.
;; 
;;    * Code line --- exists so elisp can know where commentary and/or
;; change-log sections end.
;; 
;;    * Footer line --- marks end-of-file so it can be distinguished from
;; an expanded formfeed or the results of truncation.
