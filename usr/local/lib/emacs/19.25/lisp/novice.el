;;; Commentary:

;; This mode provides a hook which is, by default, attached to various
;; putatively dangerous commands in a (probably futile) attempt to
;; prevent lusers from shooting themselves in the feet.

;;; Code:

;; This function is called (by autoloading)
;; to handle any disabled command.
;; The command is found in this-command
;; and the keys are returned by (this-command-keys).
