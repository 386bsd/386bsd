Returns (UTC-DIFF DST-OFFSET STD-ZONE DST-ZONE DST-STARTS DST-ENDS

system knows:

UTC-DIFF is an integer specifying the number of minutes difference between
    standard time in the current time zone and Coordinated Universal Time
    (Greenwich Mean Time).  A negative value means west of Greenwich.
DST-OFFSET is an integer giving the daylight savings time offset in minutes.
STD-ZONE is a string giving the name of the time zone when no seasonal time
    adjustment is in effect.
DST-ZONE is a string giving the name of the time zone when there is a seasonal
    time adjustment in effect.
DST-STARTS and DST-ENDS are sexps in the variable `year' giving the daylight
    savings time start and end rules, in the form expected by
    `calendar-daylight-savings-starts'.
DST-STARTS-TIME and DST-ENDS-TIME are integers giving the number of minutes
    after midnight that daylight savings time starts and ends.

If the local area does not use a seasonal time adjustment, STD-ZONE and
DST-ZONE are equal, and all the DST-* integer variables are 0.

Some operating systems cannot provide all this information to Emacs; in this
case, `calendar-current-time-zone' returns a list containing nil for the data
it can't find."
