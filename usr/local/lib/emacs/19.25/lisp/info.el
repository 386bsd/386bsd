  "\\<Info-mode-map>
Info mode provides commands for browsing through the Info documentation tree.
Documentation in Info is divided into \"nodes\", each of which discusses
one topic and contains references to other nodes which discuss related
topics.  Info has commands to follow the references and show you other nodes.

\\[Info-help]	Invoke the Info tutorial.

Selecting other nodes:
\\[Info-next]	Move to the \"next\" node of this node.
\\[Info-prev]	Move to the \"previous\" node of this node.
\\[Info-up]	Move \"up\" from this node.
\\[Info-menu]	Pick menu item specified by name (or abbreviation).
	Picking a menu item causes another node to be selected.
\\[Info-directory]	Go to the Info directory node.
\\[Info-follow-reference]	Follow a cross reference.  Reads name of reference.
\\[Info-last]	Move to the last node you were at.
\\[Info-index]	Look up a topic in this file's Index and move to that node.
\\[Info-index-next]	(comma) Move to the next match from a previous `i' command.

Moving within a node:
\\[Info-scroll-up]	Normally, scroll forward a full screen.  If the end of the buffer is
already visible, try to go to the next menu entry, or up if there is none.
\\[Info-scroll-down]  Normally, scroll backward.  If the beginning of the buffer is
already visible, try to go to the previous menu entry, or up if there is none.
\\[beginning-of-buffer]	Go to beginning of node.  

Advanced commands:
\\[Info-exit]	Quit Info: reselect previously selected buffer.
\\[Info-edit]	Edit contents of selected node.
1	Pick first item in node's menu.
2, 3, 4, 5   Pick second ... fifth item in node's menu.
\\[Info-goto-node]	Move to node specified by name.
	You may include a filename as well, as (FILENAME)NODENAME.
\\[universal-argument] \\[info]	Move to new Info file with completion.
\\[Info-search]	Search through this Info file for specified regexp,
	and select the node in which the next occurrence is found.
\\[Info-next-preorder]	Next-preorder; that is, try to go to the next menu item,
	and if that fails try to move up, and if that fails, tell user
 	he/she is done reading.
\\[Info-next-reference]	Move cursor to next cross-reference or menu item.
\\[Info-prev-reference]	Move cursor to previous cross-reference or menu item."
