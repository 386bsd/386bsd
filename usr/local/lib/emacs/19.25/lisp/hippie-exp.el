;;; Commentary:
;;  
;;  `hippie-expand' is a single function for a lot of different kinds
;;  of completions and expansions.  Called repeatedly it tries all
;;  possible completions in succession. 
;;  Which kinds of completions to try, and in which order, is
;;  determined by the contents of `hippie-expand-try-functions-list'.
;;  Much customization of `hippie-expand' can be made by changing the
;;  order of, removing, or inserting new functions in this list.
;;  Given a positive numeric argument, `hippie-expand' jumps directly
;;  ARG functions forward in this list.  Given some other argument
;;  (a negative argument or just Ctrl-U) it undoes the tried
;;  completion.
;;
;;  If the variable `hippie-expand-verbose' is non-nil, `hippie-expand'
;;  outputs in a message which try-function in the list that is used
;;  currently (ie. was used currently and will be tried first the next
;;  time).
;;  The variable `hippie-expand-max-buffers' determines in how many
;;  buffers, apart from the current, to search for expansions in.  It
;;  is used by the try-functions named "-all-buffers".
;;  The variable `hippie-expand-ignore-buffers' is a list of regexps
;;  matching buffer names (as strings) or major modes (as atoms) of
;;  buffers that should not be searched by the try-functions named
;;  "-all-buffers".
;;  See also the macro `make-hippie-expand-function' below.
;;  
;;  A short description of the current try-functions in this file:
;;    `try-complete-file-name' : very convenient to have in any buffer,
;;      and not just in the minibuffer or (some) shell-mode.  It goes
;;      through all possible completions instead of just completing as
;;      much as is unique.
;;    `try-complete-file-name-partially' : To insert in the list just
;;      before `try-complete-file-name' for those who want first to get
;;      a file name completed only as many characters as is unique.
;;    `try-expand-all-abbrevs' : can be removed if you don't use abbrevs.
;;      Otherwise it looks through all abbrev-tables, starting with
;;      the local followed by the global. 
;;    `try-expand-line' : Searches the buffer for an entire line that 
;;      begins exactly as the current line.  Convenient sometimes, for 
;;      example as a substitute for (or complement to) the history
;;      list in shell-like buffers.  At other times, only confusing.
;;    `try-expand-line-all-buffers' : Like `try-expand-line' but searches
;;      in all buffers (except the current).  (This may be a little
;;      slow, don't use it unless you are really fond of `hippie-expand'.)
;;    `try-expand-list' : Tries to expand the text back to the nearest
;;      open delimiter, to a whole list from the buffer. Convenient for
;;      example when writing lisp or TeX.
;;    `try-expand-list-all-buffers' : Like `try-expand-list' but searches 
;;      in all buffers (except the current).  
;;    `try-expand-dabbrev' : works exactly as dabbrev-expand (but of
;;      course in a way compatible with the other try-functions).
;;    `try-expand-dabbrev-all-buffers' : perhaps the most useful of them,
;;      like `dabbrev-expand' but searches all Emacs buffers (except the
;;      current) for matching words.  (No, I don't find this one
;;      particularly slow.) 
;;    `try-complete-lisp-symbol' : like `lisp-complete-symbol', but goes
;;      through all possibilities instead of completing what is unique.
;;      Might be tedious (usually a lot of possible completions) and
;;      since its function is much like `lisp-complete-symbol', which
;;      already has a key of its own, you might want to remove this.
;;    `try-complete-lisp-symbol-partially' : To insert in the list just
;;      before `try-complete-lisp-symbol' for those who first want to get
;;      completion of what is unique in the name.  
;;
;;  Not all of the above functions are by default in
;;  `hippie-expand-try-functions-list'.  This variable is better set
;;  in ".emacs" to make `hippie-expand' behave maximally convenient
;;  according to personal taste.  Also, instead of loading the
;;  variable with all kinds of try-functions above, it might be an
;;  idea to use `make-hippie-expand-function' to construct different
;;  `hippie-expand'-like functions, with different try-lists and bound
;;  to different keys. It is also possible to make
;;  `hippie-expand-try-functions-list' a buffer local variable, and
;;  let it depend on the mode (by setting it in the mode-hooks).
;;
;;  To write new try-functions, consider the following:
;;  Each try-function takes one argument OLD which is nil the first
;;  time the function is called and true in succeeding calls for the
;;  same string to complete.  The first time the function has to
;;  extract the string before point to complete, and substitute the
;;  first completion alternative for it.  On following calls it has to
;;  substitute the next possible completion for the last tried string.
;;  The try-function is to return t as long as it finds new
;;  possible completions.  When there are no more alternatives it has
;;  to restore the text before point to its original contents, and
;;  return nil (don't beep or message or anything).
;;  The try-function can (should) use the following functions:
;;    `he-init-string' : Initializes the text to substitute to the
;;      contents of the region BEGIN to END.  Also sets the variable
;;      `he-search-string' to the text to expand.
;;    `he-substitute-string' : substitutes STR into the region
;;      initialized with `he-init-string'.  (An optional second argument
;;      TRANS-CASE non-nil, means transfer of case from the abbreviation
;;      to the expansion is ok if that is enabled in the buffer.)
;;    `he-reset-string' : Resets the initialized region to its original
;;      contents.
;;  There is also a variable: `he-tried-table' which is meant to contain
;;  all tried expansions so far.  The try-function can check this 
;;  variable to see whether an expansion has already been tried
;;  (hint: `he-string-member'), and add its own tried expansions to it.
;;
;;  Known bugs
;;
;;  It may happen that some completion suggestion occurs twice, in
;;  spite of the use of `he-tried-table' to prevent that.  This is 
;;  because different try-functions may try to complete different
;;  lengths of text, and thus put different amounts of the
;;  text in `he-try-table'.  Anyway this seems to occur seldom enough not
;;  to be too disturbing.  Also it should NOT be possible for the
;;  opposite situation to occur, that `hippie-expand' misses some
;;  suggestion because it thinks it has already tried it.
;;
;;  Acknowledgement
;;
;;  I want to thank Mikael Djurfeldt in discussions with whom the idea
;;  of this function took form.
;;  I am also grateful to all those who have given me suggestions on
;;  how to improve it.
