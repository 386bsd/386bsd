The master menu has the following format, which is adapted from the
recommendation in the Texinfo Manual:

   * The first part contains the major nodes in the Texinfo file: the
     nodes for the chapters, chapter-like sections, and the major
     appendices.  This includes the indices, so long as they are in
     chapter-like sections, such as unnumbered sections.

   * The second and subsequent parts contain a listing of the other,
     lower level menus, in order.  This way, an inquirer can go
     directly to a particular node if he or she is searching for
     specific information.

Each of the menus in the detailed node listing is introduced by the

  "Major mode for editing Texinfo files.

  It has these extra commands:
\\{texinfo-mode-map}

  These are files that are used as input for TeX to make printed manuals
and also to be turned into Info files with \\[makeinfo-buffer] or
the `makeinfo' program.  These files must be written in a very restricted and
modified version of TeX input format.

  Editing commands are like text-mode except that the syntax table is
set up so expression commands skip Texinfo bracket groups.  To see
what the Info version of a region of the Texinfo file will look like,
use \\[makeinfo-region], which runs `makeinfo' on the current region.

  You can show the structure of a Texinfo file with \\[texinfo-show-structure].
This command shows the structure of a Texinfo file by listing the
lines with the @-sign commands for @chapter, @section, and the like.
These lines are displayed in another window called the *Occur* window.
In that window, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and
use \\[occur-mode-goto-occurrence], to jump to the corresponding spot
in the Texinfo file.

  In addition, Texinfo mode provides commands that insert various
frequently used @-sign commands into the buffer.  You can use these
commands to save keystrokes.  And you can insert balanced braces with
\\[texinfo-insert-braces] and later use the command \\[up-list] to
move forward past the closing brace.

Also, Texinfo mode provides functions for automatically creating or
updating menus and node pointers.  These functions

  * insert the `Next', `Previous' and `Up' pointers of a node,
  * insert or update the menu for a section, and
  * create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.

Here are the functions:

    texinfo-update-node                \\[texinfo-update-node]
    texinfo-every-node-update          \\[texinfo-every-node-update]
    texinfo-sequential-node-update 

    texinfo-make-menu                  \\[texinfo-make-menu]
    texinfo-all-menus-update           \\[texinfo-all-menus-update]
    texinfo-master-menu

    texinfo-indent-menu-description (column &optional region-p)

The `texinfo-column-for-description' variable specifies the column to
which menu descriptions are indented. 

Passed an argument (a prefix argument, if interactive), the
`texinfo-update-node' and `texinfo-make-menu' functions do their jobs
in the region.

To use the updating commands, you must structure your Texinfo file
hierarchically, such that each `@node' line, with the exception of the
Top node, is accompanied by some kind of section line, such as an
`@chapter' or `@section' line.

If the file has a `top' node, it must be called `top' or `Top' and
be the first node in the file.

Entering Texinfo mode calls the value of text-mode-hook, and then the
value of texinfo-mode-hook."
