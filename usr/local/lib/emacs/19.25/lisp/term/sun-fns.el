;;; Functions for manipulating via the mouse and mouse-map definitions
;;; for accessing them.  Also definitions of mouse menus.
;;; This file you should freely modify to reflect you personal tastes.
;;;
;;; First half of file defines functions to implement mouse commands,
;;; Don't delete any of those, just add what ever else you need.
;;; Second half of file defines mouse bindings, do whatever you want there.

;;;
;;;         Mouse Functions.
;;;
;;; These functions follow the sun-mouse-handler convention of being called
;;; with three arguments: (window x-pos y-pos)
;;; This makes it easy for a mouse executed command to know where the mouse is.
;;; Use the macro "eval-in-window" to execute a function 
;;; in a temporarily selected window.
;;;
;;; If you have a function that must be called with other arguments
;;; bind the mouse button to an s-exp that contains the necessary parameters.
;;; See "minibuffer" bindings for examples.
;;;

;;; Code:

;;;           Global Mouse Bindings.
;;;
;;; There is some sense to this mouse binding madness:
;;; LEFT and RIGHT scrolls are inverses.
;;; SHIFT makes an opposite meaning in the scroll bar.
;;; SHIFT is an alternative to DOUBLE (but double chords do not exist).
;;; META makes the scrollbar functions work in the text region.
;;; MIDDLE operates the mark
;;; LEFT operates at point

;;; META commands are generally non-destructive,
;;; SHIFT is a little more dangerous.
;;; CONTROL is for the really complicated ones.

;;; CONTROL-META-SHIFT-RIGHT gives help on that region.
