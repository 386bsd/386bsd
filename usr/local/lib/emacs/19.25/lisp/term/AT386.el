;;; Commentary:

;;; Uses the Emacs 19 terminal initialization features --- won't work with 18.

;;; Code:

(if (boundp 'AT386-keypad-map)
    nil
  ;; The terminal initialization should already have set up some keys
  (setq AT386-keypad-map (lookup-key function-key-map "\e["))
  (if (not (keymapp AT386-keypad-map))
      (error "What?  Your AT386 termcap/terminfo has no keycaps in it."))

  ;; Equivalents of these are set up automatically by termcap/terminfo
  ;;  (define-key AT386-keypad-map "A" [up])
  ;;  (define-key AT386-keypad-map "B" [down])
  ;;  (define-key AT386-keypad-map "C" [right])
  ;;  (define-key AT386-keypad-map "D" [left])

  ;; These would be set up by terminfo, but not termcap
  (define-key AT386-keypad-map "H" [home])
  (define-key AT386-keypad-map "Y" [end])
  (define-key AT386-keypad-map "U" [next])	;; PgDn
  (define-key AT386-keypad-map "V" [prior])	;; PgUp
  (define-key AT386-keypad-map "@" [insert])	;; Ins key

  ;; These are not normally set up by either
  (define-key AT386-keypad-map "G" [kp-5])	;; Unlabeled center key
  (define-key AT386-keypad-map "S" [kp-subtract])
  (define-key AT386-keypad-map "T" [kp-add])

  ;; Arrange for the ALT key to be equivalent to ESC
  (define-key function-key-map "\eN" [27]) ; ALT map
  )
