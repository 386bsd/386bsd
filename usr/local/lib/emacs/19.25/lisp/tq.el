;;; Commentary:
 
;;; manages receiving a stream asynchronously, 
;;; parsing it into transactions, and then calling
;;; handler functions

;;; Our basic structure is the queue/process/buffer triple.  Each entry
;;; of the queue is a regexp/closure/function triple.  We buffer
;;; bytes from the process until we see the regexp at the head of the
;;; queue.  Then we call the function with the closure and the
;;; collected bytes.

;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defun tq-create (process)
  "Create and return a transaction queue communicating with PROCESS.
PROCESS should be a subprocess capable of sending and receiving
streams of bytes.  It may be a local process, or it may be connected
to a tcp server on another machine."
  (let ((tq (cons nil (cons process
			    (generate-new-buffer
			     (concat " tq-temp-"
				     (process-name process)))))))
    (set-process-filter process
			(`(lambda (proc string)
			   (tq-filter  '(, tq) string))))
