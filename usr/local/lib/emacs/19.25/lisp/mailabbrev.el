;;; Commentary:

;;; This file ensures that, when the point is in a To:, CC:, BCC:, or From: 
;;; field, word-abbrevs are defined for each of your mail aliases.  These
;;; aliases will be defined from your .mailrc file (or the file specified by
;;; the MAILRC environment variable) if it exists.  Your mail aliases will
;;; expand any time you type a word-delimiter at the end of an abbreviation.
;;;
;;; What you see is what you get: no abbreviations will be expanded after you
;;; have sent the mail, unlike the old system.  This means you don't suffer
;;; the annoyance of having the system do things behind your back -- if an
;;; address you typed is going to be rewritten, you know it immediately,
;;; instead of after the mail has been sent and it's too late to do anything
;;; about it.  You will never again be screwed because you forgot to delete an
;;; old alias from your .mailrc when a new local user arrives and is given a
;;; userid which conflicts with one of your aliases, for example.
;;;
;;; Your mail alias abbrevs will be in effect only when the point is in an
;;; appropriate header field.  When in the body of the message, or other
;;; header fields, the mail aliases will not expand.  Rather, the normal
;;; mode-specific abbrev table (mail-mode-abbrev-table) will be used if 
;;; defined.  So if you use mail-mode specific abbrevs, this code will not
;;; adversely affect you.  You can control which header fields the abbrevs
;;; are used in by changing the variable mail-abbrev-mode-regexp.
;;;
;;; If auto-fill mode is on, abbrevs will wrap at commas instead of at word
;;; boundaries; also, header continuation-lines will be properly indented.
;;;
;;; You can also insert a mail alias with mail-interactive-insert-alias
;;; (bound to C-c C-a), which prompts you for an alias (with completion)
;;; and inserts its expansion at point.
;;;
;;; This file fixes a bug in the old system which prohibited your .mailrc
;;; file from having lines like
;;;
;;;     alias someone "John Doe <doe@quux.com>"
;;;
;;; That is, if you want an address to have embedded spaces, simply surround it
;;; with double-quotes.  This is necessary because the format of the .mailrc
;;; file bogusly uses spaces as address delimiters.  The following line defines
;;; an alias which expands to three addresses:
;;;
;;;     alias foobar addr-1 addr-2 "address three <addr-3>"
;;;
;;; (This is bogus because mail-delivery programs want commas, not spaces,
;;; but that's what the file format is, so we have to live with it.)
;;;
;;; If you like, you can call the function define-mail-abbrev to define your
;;; mail aliases instead of using a .mailrc file.  When you call it in this
;;; way, addresses are separated by commas.
;;;
;;; CAVEAT: This works on most Sun systems; I have been told that some versions
;;; of /bin/mail do not understand double-quotes in the .mailrc file.  So you
;;; should make sure your version does before including verbose addresses like
;;; this.  One solution to this, if you are on a system whose /bin/mail doesn't
;;; work that way, (and you still want to be able to /bin/mail to send mail in
;;; addition to emacs) is to define minimal aliases (without full names) in
;;; your .mailrc file, and use define-mail-abbrev to redefine them when sending
;;; mail from emacs; this way, mail sent from /bin/mail will work, and mail
;;; sent from emacs will be pretty.
;;;
;;; Aliases in the mailrc file may be nested.  If you define aliases like
;;;     alias group1 fred ethel
;;;     alias group2 larry curly moe
;;;     alias everybody group1 group2
;;; Then when you type "everybody" on the To: line, it will be expanded to
;;;     fred, ethyl, larry, curly, moe
;;;
;;; Aliases may also contain forward references; the alias of "everybody" can
;;; precede the aliases of "group1" and "group2".
;;;
;;; This code also understands the "source" .mailrc command, for reading
;;; aliases from some other file as well.
;;;
;;; Aliases may contain hyphens, as in "alias foo-bar foo@bar"; word-abbrevs
;;; normally cannot contain hyphens, but this code works around that for the
;;; specific case of mail-alias word-abbrevs.
;;;
;;; To read in the contents of another .mailrc-type file from emacs, use the
;;; command Meta-X merge-mail-abbrevs.  The rebuild-mail-abbrevs command is
;;; similar, but will delete existing aliases first.
;;;
;;; If you would like your aliases to be expanded when you type M-> or ^N to
;;; move out of the mail-header into the message body (instead of having to
;;; type SPC at the end of the abbrev before moving away) then you can do
;;;
;;;	(define-key mail-mode-map "\C-n" 'mail-abbrev-next-line)
;;;	(define-key mail-mode-map "\M->" 'mail-abbrev-end-of-buffer)
;;;
;;; If you want multiple addresses separated by a string other than ", " then
;;; you can set the variable mail-alias-separator-string to it.  This has to
;;; be a comma bracketed by whitespace if you want any kind of reasonable
;;; behaviour.
;;;
;;; Thanks to Harald Hanche-Olsen, Michael Ernst, David Loeffler, and
;;; Noah Friedman for suggestions and bug reports.
