  "Create and display a buffer containing the relevant lines in diary-file.
The arguments are DATE and NUMBER; the entries selected are those
for NUMBER days starting with date DATE.  The other entries are hidden
using selective display.

Returns a list of all relevant diary entries found, if any, in order by date.
The list entries have the form ((month day year) string).  If the variable
`diary-list-include-blanks' is t, this list includes a dummy diary entry
\(consisting of the empty string) for a date with no diary entries.

After the list is prepared, the hooks `nongregorian-diary-listing-hook',
`list-diary-entries-hook', `diary-display-hook', and `diary-hook' are run.
These hooks have the following distinct roles:

    `nongregorian-diary-listing-hook' can cull dates from the diary
        and each included file.  Usually used for Hebrew or Islamic
        diary entries in files.  Applied to *each* file.

    `list-diary-entries-hook' adds or manipulates diary entries from
        external sources.  Used, for example, to include diary entries
        from other files or to sort the diary entries.  Invoked *once* only,
        before the display hook is run.

    `diary-display-hook' does the actual display of information.  If this is
        nil, simple-diary-display will be used.  Use add-hook to set this to
        fancy-diary-display, if desired.  If you want no diary display, use
        add-hook to set this to ignore.

    `diary-hook' is run last.  This can be used for an appointment
        notification function."

  "Add sexp entries for DATE from the diary file to `diary-entries-list'.
Also, Make them visible in the diary file.  Returns t if any entries were

Sexp diary entries must be prefaced by a `sexp-diary-entry-symbol' (normally
`%%').  The form of a sexp diary entry is

                  %%(SEXP) ENTRY

Both ENTRY and DATE are globally available when the SEXP is evaluated.  If the
SEXP yields the value nil, the diary entry does not apply.  If it yields a
non-nil value, ENTRY will be taken to apply to DATE; if the non-nil value is a
string, that string will be the diary entry in the fancy diary display.

For example, the following diary entry will apply to the 21st of the month
if it is a weekday and the Friday before if the 21st is on a weekend:

      &%%(let ((dayname (calendar-day-of-week date))
               (day (extract-calendar-day date)))

                  (DAYNAME=0 means Sunday, 1 means Monday, and so on;
                  if N is negative it counts backward from the end of
                  the month.  MONTH can be a list of months, a single
                  month, or t to specify all months.

      %%(diary-block M1 D1 Y1 M2 D2 Y2) text
