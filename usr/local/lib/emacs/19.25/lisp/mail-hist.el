;; To use this package, put it in a directory in your load-path, and
;; put this in your .emacs file:
;;
;; (load "mail-hist" nil t)
;;
;; Or you could do it with autoloads and hooks in your .emacs:
;;
;; (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'mail-hist-define-keys)
;; (add-hook 'mail-send-hook 'mail-hist-put-headers-into-history)
;; (add-hook 'vm-mail-mode-hook 'mail-hist-define-keys) ;or rmail, etc
;; (autoload 'mail-hist-define-keys "mail-hist")
;; (autoload 'mail-hist-put-headers-into-history "mail-hist")
;;
;; Once it's installed, use M-p and M-n from mail headers to recover
;; previous/next contents in the history for that header, or, in the
;; body of the message, to recover previous/next text of the message.
;; This only applies to outgoing mail -- mail-hist ignores received
;; messages.
;;
;; Although repeated history requests do clear out the text from the
;; previous request, an isolated request just inserts its text at
;; point, so that you can mix the histories of different messages
;; easily.  This might be confusing at times, but there should be no
;; problems that undo can't handle.
