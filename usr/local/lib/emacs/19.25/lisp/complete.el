;; Commentary:

;; Extended completion for the Emacs minibuffer.
;;
;; The basic idea is that the command name or other completable text is
;; divided into words and each word is completed separately, so that
;; "M-x p-b" expands to "M-x print-buffer".  If the entry is ambiguous
;; each word is completed as much as possible and then the cursor is
;; left at the first position where typing another letter will resolve
;; the ambiguity.
;;
;; Word separators for this purpose are hyphen, space, and period.
;; These would most likely occur in command names, Info menu items,
;; and file names, respectively.  But all word separators are treated
;; alike at all times.
;;
;; This completion package replaces the old-style completer's key
;; bindings for TAB, SPC, RET, and `?'.  The old completer is still
;; available on the Meta versions of those keys.  If you set
;; PC-meta-flag to nil, the old completion keys will be left alone
;; and the partial completer will use the Meta versions of the keys.


;; Usage:  Load this file.  Now, during completable minibuffer entry,
;;
;;     TAB    means to do a partial completion;
;;     SPC    means to do a partial complete-word;
;;     RET    means to do a partial complete-and-exit;
;;     ?      means to do a partial completion-help.
;;
;; If you set PC-meta-flag to nil, then TAB, SPC, RET, and ? perform
;; original Emacs completions, and M-TAB etc. do partial completion.
;; To do this, put the command,
;;
;;       (setq PC-meta-flag nil)
;;
;; in your .emacs file.  To load partial completion automatically, put
;;
;;       (load "complete")
;;
;; in your .emacs file, too.  Things will be faster if you byte-compile
;; this file when you install it.
;;
;; As an extra feature, in cases where RET would not normally
;; complete (such as `C-x b'), the M-RET key will always do a partial
;; complete-and-exit.  Thus `C-x b f.c RET' will select or create a
;; buffer called "f.c", but `C-x b f.c M-RET' will select the existing
;; buffer whose name matches that pattern (perhaps "filing.c").
;; (PC-meta-flag does not affect this behavior; M-RET used to be
;; undefined in this situation.)
;;
;; The regular M-TAB (lisp-complete-symbol) command also supports
;; partial completion in this package.

;; This package also contains a wildcard feature for C-x C-f (find-file).
;; For example, `C-x C-f *.c RET' loads all .c files at once, exactly
;; as if you had typed C-x C-f separately for each file.  Completion
;; is supported in connection with wildcards.  Currently only the `*'
;; wildcard character works.

;; File name completion does not do partial completion of directories
;; on the path, e.g., "/u/b/f" will not complete to "/usr/bin/foo",
;; but you can put *'s in the path to accomplish this:  "/u*/b*/f".
;; Stars are required for performance reasons.

;; In addition, this package includes a feature for accessing include
;; files.  For example, `C-x C-f <sys/time.h> RET' reads the file
;; /usr/include/sys/time.h.  The variable PC-include-file-path is a
;; list of directories in which to search for include files.  Completion
;; is supported in include file names.

string, it must come first or right after `]'.  In other words, if
S is this string, then `[S]' must be a legal Emacs regular expression
\(not containing character ranges like `a-z').")
