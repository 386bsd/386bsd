;;; Commentary:

;;  This emacs lisp program can be used to create an emacs lisp file that
;;  defines the TPU-edt keypad for emacs running on x-windows.  Please read
;;  the "Usage" AND "Known Problems" sections before attempting to run this
;;  program.

;;; Usage:

;;  Simply load this file into the X-windows version of emacs (version 19)
;;  using the following command.

;;    emacs -q -l tpu-mapper.el

;;  The "-q" option prevents loading of your .emacs file (commands therein
;;  might confuse this program).

;;  An instruction screen showing the TPU-edt keypad will be displayed, and
;;  you will be prompted to press the TPU-edt editing keys.  Tpu-mapper uses
;;  the keys you press to create an emacs lisp file that will define a
;;  TPU-edt keypad for your X server.  You can even re-arrange the standard
;;  EDT keypad to suit your tastes (or to cope with those silly Sun and PC
;;  keypads).

;;  Finally, you will be prompted for the name of the file to store the key
;;  definitions.  If you chose the default, TPU-edt will find it and load it
;;  automatically.  If you specify a different file name, you will need to
;;  set the variable "tpu-xkeys-file" before loading TPU-edt.  Here's how
;;  you might go about doing that in your .emacs file.

;;    (setq tpu-xkeys-file (expand-file-name "~/.my-emacs-x-keys"))
;;    (load "tpu-edt")

;;; Known Problems:

;;  Sometimes, tpu-mapper will ignore a key you press, and just continue to
;;  prompt for the same key.  This can happen when your window manager sucks
;;  up the key and doesn't pass it on to emacs, or it could be an emacs bug.
;;  Either way, there's nothing that tpu-mapper can do about it.  You must
;;  press RETURN, to skip the current key and continue.  Later, you and/or
;;  your local X guru can try to figure out why the key is being ignored.

    This program prompts you to press keys to create a custom keymap file
    for use with the x-windows version of emacs and TPU-edt.

    Start by pressing the RETURN key, and continue by pressing the keys
    specified in the mini-buffer.  You can re-arrange the TPU-edt keypad
    by pressing any key you want at any prompt.  If you want to entirely
    omit a key, just press RETURN at the prompt.

    Here's a picture of the standard TPU/edt keypad for reference:
