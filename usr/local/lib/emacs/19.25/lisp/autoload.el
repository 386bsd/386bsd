;;; Commentary;:

;; This code helps GNU Emacs maintainers keep the loaddefs.el file up to
;; date.  It interprets magic cookies of the form ";;;###autoload" in
;; lisp source files in various useful ways.  To learn more, read the
;; source; if you're going to use this, you'd better be able to.

;;; Code:

(defun make-autoload (form file)
  "Turn FORM, a defun or defmacro, into an autoload for source file FILE.
Returns nil if FORM is not a defun or defmacro."
  (let ((car (car-safe form)))
    (if (memq car '(defun defmacro))
	(let ((macrop (eq car 'defmacro))
	      name doc)
	  (setq form (cdr form))
	  (setq name (car form))
	  ;; Ignore the arguments.
	  (setq form (cdr (cdr form)))
	  (setq doc (car form))
	  (if (stringp doc)
	      (setq form (cdr form))
	    (setq doc nil))
	  (list 'autoload (list 'quote name) file doc
		(eq (car-safe (car form)) 'interactive)
		(if macrop (list 'quote 'macro) nil)))
      nil)))

(defconst generate-autoload-cookie ";;;###autoload"
  "Magic comment indicating the following form should be autoloaded.
Used by \\[update-file-autoloads].  This string should be
meaningless to Lisp (e.g., a comment).

This string is used:

;;;###autoload
\(defun function-to-be-autoloaded () ...)

If this string appears alone on a line, the following form will be
read and an autoload made for it.  If there is further text on the line,
that text will be copied verbatim to `generated-autoload-file'.")

(defconst generate-autoload-section-header "\f\n;;;### "
  "String inserted before the form identifying
the section of autoloads for a file.")

(defconst generate-autoload-section-trailer "\n;;;***\n"
  "String which indicates the end of the section of autoloads for a file.")

;;; Forms which have doc-strings which should be printed specially.
;;; A doc-string-elt property of ELT says that (nth ELT FORM) is
;;; the doc-string in FORM.
;;;
;;; There used to be the following note here:
;;; ;;; Note: defconst and defvar should NOT be marked in this way.
;;; ;;; We don't want to produce defconsts and defvars that
;;; ;;; make-docfile can grok, because then it would grok them twice,
;;; ;;; once in foo.el (where they are given with ;;;###autoload) and
;;; ;;; once in loaddefs.el.
;;;
;;; Counter-note: Yes, they should be marked in this way.
;;; make-docfile only processes those files that are loaded into the
;;; dumped Emacs, and those files should never have anything
;;; autoloaded here.  The above-feared problem only occurs with files
;;; which have autoloaded entries *and* are processed by make-docfile;
;;; there should be no such files.
