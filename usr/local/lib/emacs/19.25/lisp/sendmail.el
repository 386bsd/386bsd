Non-nil means insert BCC to self in messages to be sent.
This is done when the message is initialized,
so you can remove or alter the BCC field to override the default.")

Non-nil means when sending a message wait for and display errors.
nil means let mailer mail back a message to report errors.")

  "Edit a message to be sent.  Prefix arg means resume editing (don't erase).
When this function returns, the buffer `*mail*' is selected.
The value is t if the message was newly initialized; otherwise, nil.

By default, the signature file `~/.signature' is inserted at the end;
see the variable `mail-signature'.

\\<mail-mode-map>
While editing message, type \\[mail-send-and-exit] to send the message and exit.

Various special commands starting with C-c are available in sendmail mode
to move to message header fields:
\\{mail-mode-map}

If `mail-self-blind' is non-nil, a BCC to yourself is inserted
when the message is initialized.

If `mail-default-reply-to' is non-nil, it should be an address (a string);
a Reply-to: field with that address is inserted.

If `mail-archive-file-name' is non-nil, an FCC field with that file name
is inserted.

If `mail-setup-hook' is bound, its value is called with no arguments
after the message is initialized.  It can add more default fields.

When calling from a program, the second through fifth arguments
 TO, SUBJECT, IN-REPLY-TO and CC specify if non-nil
 the initial contents of those header fields.
 These arguments should not have final newlines.
The sixth argument REPLYBUFFER is a buffer whose contents
 should be yanked if the user types C-c C-y.
The seventh argument ACTIONS is a list of actions to take
 if/when the message is sent.  Each action looks like (FUNCTION . ARGS);
 when the message is sent, we apply FUNCTION to ARGS.
 This is how Rmail arranges to mark messages `answered'."
