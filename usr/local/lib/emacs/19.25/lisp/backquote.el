;; This is a new backquote for GNU Emacs written by
;; Rick Sladkey <jrs@world.std.com>.  It has the following
;; features compared to the version 18 backquote:

;; Correctly handles nested backquotes.
;; Correctly handles constants after a splice.
;; Correctly handles top-level atoms and unquotes.
;; Correctly handles unquote after dot.
;; Understands vectors.
;; Minimizes gratuitous consing.
;; Faster operation with simpler semantics.
;; Generates faster run-time expressions.
;; One third fewer calories than our regular beer.

;; This backquote will generate calls to the backquote-list* form.
;; Both a function version and a macro version are included.
;; The macro version is used by default because it is faster
;; and needs no run-time support.  It should really be a subr.

;;; Code:

(provide 'backquote)

;; function and macro versions of backquote-list*

The whole structure acts as if it were quoted except for certain

For example:

\(` (a b c))       => (a b c)		; backquote acts like quote
