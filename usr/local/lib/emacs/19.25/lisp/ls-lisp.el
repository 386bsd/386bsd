;; INSTALLATION =======================================================
;; 
;; Put this file into your load-path.  To use it, load it
;; with (load "ls-lisp").

;; OVERVIEW ===========================================================

;; This file overloads the function insert-directory to implement it
;; directly from Emacs lisp, without running `ls' in a subprocess.

;; It is useful if you cannot afford to fork Emacs on a real memory UNIX,
;; under VMS, or if you don't have the ls program, or if you want
;; different format from what ls offers.

;; This function uses regexps instead of shell
;; wildcards.  If you enter regexps remember to double each $ sign.
;; For example, to include files *.el, enter `.*\.el$$',
;; resulting in the regexp `.*\.el$'.

;;  RESTRICTIONS =====================================================

;; * many ls switches are ignored, see docstring of `insert-directory'.

;; * Only numeric uid/gid

;; TODO ==============================================================

;; Recognize some more ls switches: R F

;;; Code:

(defun insert-directory (file &optional switches wildcard full-directory-p)
  "Insert directory listing for of FILE, formatted according to SWITCHES.
Leaves point after the inserted text.
Optional third arg WILDCARD means treat FILE as shell wildcard.
Optional fourth arg FULL-DIRECTORY-P means file is a directory and
switches do not contain `d', so that a full listing is expected.

This version of the function comes from `ls-lisp.el'.
It does not support ordinary shell wildcards; instead, it allows
regular expressions to match file names.

The switches that work are: A a c i r S s t u"
