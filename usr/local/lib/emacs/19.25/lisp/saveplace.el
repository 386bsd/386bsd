;; Automatically save place in files, so that visiting them later
;; (even during a different Emacs session) automatically moves point
;; to the saved position, when the file is first found.  Uses the
;; value of buffer-local variable save-place to determine whether to
;; save position or not.
;;
;; Thanks to Stefan Schoef, who sent a patch with the
;; `save-place-version-control' stuff in it.

;; this is what I was using during testing:
;; (define-key ctl-x-map "p" 'toggle-save-place)

where it was when you previously visited the same file.
This variable is automatically buffer-local.

simply put this in your `~/.emacs' file:
