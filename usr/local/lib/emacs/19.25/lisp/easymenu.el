;;; This is compatible with easymenu.el by Per Abrahamsen
;;; but it is much simpler as it doesn't try to support other Emacs versions.
;;; The code was mostly derived from lmenu.el.

;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defmacro easy-menu-define (symbol maps doc menu)
  "Define a menu bar submenu in maps MAPS, according to MENU.
The arguments SYMBOL and DOC are ignored; they are present for
compatibility only.  SYMBOL is not evaluated.  In other Emacs versions
these arguments may be used as a variable to hold the menu data, and a
doc string for that variable.

The first element of MENU must be a string.  It is the menu bar item name.
The rest of the elements are menu items.

A menu item is usually a vector of three elements:  [NAME CALLBACK ENABLE]

NAME is a string--the menu item name.

CALLBACK is a command to run when the item is chosen,
or a list to evaluate when the item is chosen.

ENABLE is a symbol; if its value is non-nil, the item is enabled
for selection.

A menu item can be a string.  Then that string appears in the menu as
unselectable text.  A string consisting solely of hyphens is displayed
as a solid horizontal line.

A menu item can be a list.  It is treated as a submenu.
The first element should be the submenu name.  That's used as the
menu item in the top-level menu.  The cdr of the submenu list
is a list of menu items, as above."
