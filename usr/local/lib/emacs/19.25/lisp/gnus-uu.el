;;; Commentary:

;; All gnus-uu commands start with `C-c C-v'.
;;
;; Short user manual for this package:
;;
;; Type `C-c C-v C-v' to decode and view all articles of the current
;; series. The defaults should be reasonable for most systems.
;;
;; Type `C-c C-v C-i' to toggle interactive mode. When using
;; interactive mode, gnus-uu will which display a buffer that will let
;; you see the suggested commands to be executed.
;;
;; To post an uuencoded file, type `C-c C-v p', which will enter you
;; into a buffer analogous to the one you will get when typing `a'. Do
;; an `M-x describe-mode' in this buffer to get a description of what
;; this buffer lets you do.
;;
;; Read the documentation of the `gnus-uu' dummy function for a more
;; complete description of what this package does and how you can
;; customize it to fit your needs.
;; 
;;
;;
;; History
;;
;; v1.0: First version released Oct 2 1992.
;;
;; v1.1: Changed `C-c C-r' to `C-c C-e' and `C-c C-p' to `C-c C-k'.
;; Changed (setq gnus-exit-group-hook) to (add-hook).  Removed
;; checking for "Re:" for finding parts.
;;
;; v2.2: Fixed handling of currupted archives. Changed uudecoding to
;; an asynchronous process to avoid loading tons of data into emacs
;; buffers. No longer reads articles emacs already have aboard.  Fixed
;; a firmer support for shar files. Made regexp searches for files
;; more convenient. Added `C-c C-l' for editing uucode begin
;; lines. Added multi-system decoder entry point. Added interactive
;; view mode. Added function for decoding and saving all uuencoded
;; articles in the current newsgroup.
;;
;; v2.3: After suggestions I have changed all the gnus-uu key bindings
;; to avoid hogging all the user keys (C-c LETTER). Also added
;; (provide) and fixed some saving stuff. First posted version to
;; gnu.emacs.sources.
;;
;; v2.4: Fixed some more in the save-all category. Automatic fixing of
;; uucode "begin" lines: names on the form of "dir/file" are
;; translated into "dir-file". Added a function for fixing stripped
;; uucode articles. Added binhex save.
;;
;; v2.5: First version copyrighted by FSF. Changed lots of
;; documentation strings.
;;
;; v2.5.1: Added uuencode/posting code to post binary files. 
;;
;; v2.6: Thread support. gnus-uu is now able to decode uuencoded files
;; posted in threads. gnus-uu can also post in threads. I don't know
;; if this ability is of much use - I've never seen anyone post
;; uuencoded files in threads.
;;
;; v2.7: gnus-uu is now able to decode (and view/save) multiple
;; encoded files in one big gulp. Also added pseudo-mime support
;; (users can use metamail to view files), posting uuencoded/mime
;; files and various other bits and pieces.
;;
;; v2.7.1: New functions for decoding/saving threads bound to `C-c
;; C-v C-j'. Handy to save entire threads, not very useful for
;; decoding, as nobody posts encoded files in threads...
;;
;; V2.7.2: New functions for digesting and forwarding articles added
;; on the suggestion of Per Abrahamsen. Also added a function for
;; marking threads.

Function description:

`gnus-uu-decode-and-view' will try to find all articles in the same
series, uudecode them and view the resulting file(s).

gnus-uu guesses what articles are in the series according to the
following simplish rule: The subjects must be (nearly) identical,
except for the last two numbers of the line. (Spaces are largely
ignored, however.)

For example: If you choose a subject called 
  \"cat.gif (2/3)\"
gnus-uu will find all the articles that matches
  \"^cat.gif ([0-9]+/[0-9]+).*$\".  

Subjects that are nonstandard, like 
  \"cat.gif (2/3) Part 6 of a series\", 
will not be properly recognized by any of the automatic viewing
commands, and you have to mark the articles manually with '#'.

`gnus-uu-decode-and-save' will do the same as
`gnus-uu-decode-and-view', except that it will not display the
resulting file, but save it instead.

`gnus-uu-shar-and-view' and `gnus-uu-shar-and-save' are the \"shar\"
equivalents to the uudecode functions. Instead of feeding the articles
to uudecode, they are run through /bin/sh. Most shar files can be
viewed and/or saved with the normal uudecode commands, which is much
safer, as no foreign code is run.

Instead of having windows popping up automatically, it can be handy to
view files interactivly, especially when viewing archives. Use
`gnus-uu-toggle-interactive-mode' to toggle interactive mode.

`gnus-uu-mark-article' marks an article for later
decoding/unsharing/saving/viewing. The files will be decoded in the
sequence they were marked. To decode the files after you've marked the
articles you are interested in, type the corresponding key strokes as
the normal decoding commands, but put a `M-' in the last
keystroke. For instance, to perform a standard uudecode and view, you
would type `C-c C-v C-v'. To perform a marked uudecode and view, say
`C-v C-v M-C-v'. All the other view and save commands are handled the
same way; marked uudecode and save is then `C-c C-v M-v'.

`gnus-uu-unmark-article' will remove the mark from a previosly marked
article.

`gnus-uu-unmark-all-articles' will remove the mark from all marked
articles.

`gnus-uu-mark-by-regexp' will prompt for a regular expression and mark
all articles matching that regular expression.

`gnus-uu-mark-thread' will mark all articles downward in the current
thread.

There's an additional way to reach the decoding functions to make
future expansions easier: `gnus-uu-multi-decode-and-view' and the
corresponding save, marked view and marked save functions. You will be
prompted for a decoding method, like uudecode, shar, binhex or plain
save. Note that methods like binhex and save doesn't have view modes;
even if you issue a view command (`C-c C-v C-m' and \"binhex\"),
gnus-uu will just save the resulting binhex file.

`gnus-uu-decode-and-show-in-buffer' will decode the current article
and display the results in an emacs buffer. This might be useful if
there's jsut some text in the current article that has been uuencoded
by some perverse poster.

`gnus-uu-decode-and-save-all-articles' looks at all the articles in
the current newsgroup and tries to uudecode everything it can
find. The user will be prompted for a directory where the resulting
files (if any) will be
saved. `gnus-uu-decode-and-save-unread-articles' does only checks
unread articles. 

`gnus-uu-decode-and-view-all-articles' does the same as the function
above, only viewing files instead of saving them. 

`gnus-uu-edit-begin-line' lets you edit the begin line of an uuencoded
file in the current article. Useful to change a corrupted begin line.


When using the view commands, `gnus-uu-decode-and-view' for instance,
gnus-uu will (normally, see below) try to view the file according to
the rules given in `gnus-uu-default-view-rules' and
`gnus-uu-user-view-rules'. If it recognizes the file, it will display
it immediately. If the file is some sort of archive, gnus-uu will
attempt to unpack the archive and see if any of the files in the
archive can be viewed. For instance, if you have a gzipped tar file
\"pics.tar.gz\" containing the files \"pic1.jpg\" and \"pic2.gif\",
gnus-uu will uncompress and detar the main file, and then view the two
pictures. This unpacking process is recursive, so if the archive
contains archives of archives, it'll all be unpacked.

If the view command doesn't recognise the file type, or can't view it
because you don't have the viewer, or can't view *any* of the files in
the archive, the user will be asked if she wishes to have the file
saved somewhere. Note that if the decoded file is an archive, and
gnus-uu manages to view some of the files in the archive, it won't
tell the user that there were some files that were unviewable. Try
interactive view for a different approach.


Note that gnus-uu adds a function to `gnus-exit-group-hook' to clear
the list of marked articles and check for any generated files that
might have escaped deletion if the user typed `C-g' during viewing.


`gnus-uu-toggle-asynchronous' toggles the `gnus-uu-asynchronous'
variable.

`gnus-uu-toggle-query' toggles the `gnus-uu-ask-before-view'
variable.

`gnus-uu-toggle-always-ask' toggles the `gnus-uu-view-and-save'
variable.

`gnus-uu-toggle-kill-carriage-return' toggles the
`gnus-uu-kill-carriage-return' variable.

`gnus-uu-toggle-interactive-view' toggles interactive mode. If it is
turned on, gnus-uu won't view files immediately, but will give you a
buffer with the default commands and files and let you edit the
commands and execute them at leisure.

`gnus-uu-toggle-correct-stripped-articles' toggles whether to check
and correct uuencoded articles that may have had trailing spaces
stripped by mailers.

`gnus-uu-toggle-view-with-metamail' toggles whether to skip the
gnus-uu viewing methods and just guess at an content-type based on the
file name suffix and feed it to metamail.

`gnus-uu-toggle-any-variable' is an interface to the toggle commands
listed above.


Customization

   Rule Variables

   gnus-uu uses \"rule\" variables to decide how to view a file. All
   these variables are of the form
  
      (list '(regexp1 command2)
            '(regexp2 command2)
            ...)

   `gnus-uu-user-view-rules'
     This variable is consulted first when viewing files. If you wish
     to use, for instance, sox to convert an .au sound file, you could
     say something like:

       (setq gnus-uu-user-view-rules
         (list '(\"\\\\.au$\" \"sox %s -t .aiff > /dev/audio\")))

   `gnus-uu-user-view-rules-end'
     This variable is consulted if gnus-uu couldn't make any matches
     from the user and default view rules.

   `gnus-uu-user-interactive-view-rules'
     This is the variable used instead of `gnus-uu-user-view-rules'
     when in interactive mode.

   `gnus-uu-user-interactive-view-rules-end'
     This variable is used instead of `gnus-uu-user-view-rules-end'
     when in interactive mode.

   `gnus-uu-user-archive-rules`
     This variable can be used to say what comamnds should be used to
     unpack archives.

   
   Other Variables

   `gnus-uu-tmp-dir'
     Where gnus-uu does its work.

   `gnus-uu-do-not-unpack-archives'
     Non-nil means that gnus-uu won't peek inside archives looking for
     files to dispay.

   `gnus-uu-view-and-save'
     Non-nil means that the user will always be asked to save a file
     after viewing it.

   `gnus-uu-asynchronous' 
     Non-nil means that files will be viewed asynchronously.  This can
     be useful if you're viewing long .mod files, for instance, which
     often takes several minutes. Note, however, that since gnus-uu
     doesn't ask, and if you are viewing an archive with lots of
     viewable files, you'll get them all up more or less at once,
     which can be confusing, to say the least. To get gnus-uu to ask
     you before viewing a file, set the `gnus-uu-ask-before-view' 
     variable.

   `gnus-uu-ask-before-view'
     Non-nil means that gnus-uu will ask you before viewing each file

   `gnus-uu-ignore-default-view-rules'
     Non-nil means that gnus-uu will ignore the default viewing rules.

   `gnus-uu-ignore-default-archive-rules'
     Non-nil means that gnus-uu will ignore the default archive
     unpacking commands.

   `gnus-uu-kill-carriage-return'
     Non-nil means that gnus-uu will strip all carriage returns from
     articles.

   `gnus-uu-unmark-articles-not-decoded'
     Non-nil means that gnus-uu will mark articles that were
     unsuccessfully decoded as unread.

   `gnus-uu-output-window-height'
     This variable says how tall the output buffer window is to be
     when using interactive view mode.

   `gnus-uu-correct-stripped-uucode'
     Non-nil means that gnus-uu will *try* to fix uuencoded files that
     have had traling spaces deleted.

   `gnus-uu-use-interactive-view'
     Non-nil means that gnus-uu will use interactive viewing mode.

   `gnus-uu-view-with-metamail'
     Non-nil means that gnus-uu will ignore the viewing commands
     defined by the rule variables and just fudge a MIME content type
     based on the file name. The result will be fed to metamail for
     viewing.

   `gnus-uu-save-in-digest'
     Non-nil means that gnus-uu, when asked to save without decoding,
     will save in digests.  If this variable is nil, gnus-uu will just
     save everything in a file without any embellishments. The
     digesting almost conforms to RFC1153 - no easy way to specify any
     meaningful volume and issue numbers were found, so I simply
     dropped them.

   `gnus-uu-post-include-before-composing'
     Non-nil means that gnus-uu will ask for a file to encode before
     you compose the article.  If this variable is t, you can either
     include an encoded file with \\<gnus-uu-post-reply-mode-map>\\[gnus-uu-post-insert-binary-in-article] or have one included for you when you 
     post the article.

   `gnus-uu-post-length'
     Maximum length of an article.  The encoded file will be split
     into how many articles it takes to post the entire file.

   `gnus-uu-post-threaded'
     Non-nil means that gnus-uu will post the encoded file in a
     thread.  This may not be smart, as no other decoder I have seen
     are able to follow threads when collecting uuencoded
     articles. (Well, I have seen one package that does that -
     gnus-uu, but somehow, I don't think that counts...) Default is
     nil.

   `gnus-uu-post-separate-description'
     Non-nil means that the description will be posted in a separate
     article.  The first article will typically be numbered (0/x). If
     this variable is nil, the description the user enters will be
     included at the beginning of the first article, which will be
     numbered (1/x). Default is t.

  "Default actions to be taken when the user asks to view a file.  
To change the behaviour, you can either edit this variable or set
`gnus-uu-user-view-rules' to something useful.

For example:

To make gnus-uu use 'xli' to display JPEG and GIF files, put the
following in your .emacs file

  (setq gnus-uu-user-view-rules (list '(\"jpg$\\\\|gif$\" \"xli\")))

Both these variables are lists of lists with two string elements. The
first string is a regular expression. If the file name matches this
regular expression, the command in the second string is executed with
the file as an argument.

If the command string contains \"%s\", the file name will be inserted
at that point in the command string. If there's no \"%s\" in the
command string, the file name will be appended to the command string
before executing.

There are several user variables to tailor the behaviour of gnus-uu to
your needs. First we have `gnus-uu-user-view-rules', which is the
variable gnus-uu first consults when trying to decide how to view a
file. If this variable contains no matches, gnus-uu examines the
default rule vaiable provided in this package. If gnus-uu finds no
match here, it uses `gnus-uu-user-view-rules-end' to try to make a
match.

Unless, of course, you are using the interactive view mode. Then
`gnus-uu-user-interactive-view-rules' and
`gnus-uu-user-interactive-view-rules-end' will be used instead.")

   Relevant Variables

   `gnus-uu-post-encode-method' 
   There are three functions supplied with gnus-uu for encoding files:
   `gnus-uu-post-encode-uuencode', which does straight uuencoding;
   `gnus-uu-post-encode-mime', which encodes with base64 and adds MIME 
   headers; and `gnus-uu-post-encode-mime-uuencode', which encodes with 
   uuencode and adds MIME headers.
 
   `gnus-uu-post-include-before-composing'
   Non-nil means that gnus-uu will ask for a file to encode before you
   compose the article.  If this variable is t, you can either include
   an encoded file with `C-c C-i' or have one included for you when you 
   post the article.

   `gnus-uu-post-length'
   Maximum length of an article. The encoded file will be split into how 
   many articles it takes to post the entire file.

   `gnus-uu-post-separate-description'
   Non-nil means that the description will be posted in a separate 
   article. The first article will typically be numbered (0/x). If 
   this variable is nil, the description the user enters will be 
   included at the beginning of the first article, which will be 
   numbered (1/x). Default is t.

   `gnus-uu-post-threaded'
   Non-nil means that gnus-uu will post the encoded file in a thread.
   This may not be smart, as no other decoder I have seen are able to
   follow threads when collecting uuencoded articles. (Well, I have seen
   one package that does that - gnus-uu, but somehow, I don't think that 
   counts...) Default is nil.
