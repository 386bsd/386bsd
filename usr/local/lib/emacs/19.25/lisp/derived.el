;;; Commentary:

;; GNU Emacs is already, in a sense, object oriented -- each object
;; (buffer) belongs to a class (major mode), and that class defines
;; the relationship between messages (input events) and methods
;; (commands) by means of a keymap.
;;
;; The only thing missing is a good scheme of inheritance.  It is
;; possible to simulate a single level of inheritance with generous
;; use of hooks and a bit of work -- sgml-mode, for example, also runs
;; the hooks for text-mode, and keymaps can inherit from other keymaps
;; -- but generally, each major mode ends up reinventing the wheel.
;; Ideally, someone should redesign all of Emacs's major modes to
;; follow a more conventional object-oriented system: when defining a
;; new major mode, the user should need only to name the existing mode
;; it is most similar to, then list the (few) differences.
;;
;; In the mean time, this package offers most of the advantages of
;; full inheritance with the existing major modes.  The macro
;; `define-derived-mode' allows the user to make a variant of an existing
;; major mode, with its own keymap.  The new mode will inherit the key
;; bindings of its parent, and will, in fact, run its parent first
;; every time it is called.  For example, the commands
;;
;;  (define-derived-mode hypertext-mode text-mode "Hypertext"
;;    "Major mode for hypertext.\n\n\\{hypertext-mode-map}"
;;    (setq case-fold-search nil))
;;
;;  (define-key hypertext-mode-map [down-mouse-3] 'do-hyper-link)
;;
;; will create a function `hypertext-mode' with its own (sparse)
;; keymap `hypertext-mode-map.'  The command M-x hypertext-mode will
;; perform the following actions:
;;
;; - run the command (text-mode) to get its default setup
;; - replace the current keymap with 'hypertext-mode-map,' which will
;;   inherit from 'text-mode-map'.
;; - replace the current syntax table with
;;   'hypertext-mode-syntax-table', which will borrow its defaults
;;   from the current text-mode-syntax-table.
;; - replace the current abbrev table with
;;   'hypertext-mode-abbrev-table', which will borrow its defaults
;;   from the current text-mode-abbrev table
;; - change the mode line to read "Hypertext"
;; - assign the value 'hypertext-mode' to the 'major-mode' variable
;; - run the body of commands provided in the macro -- in this case,
;;   set the local variable `case-fold-search' to nil.
;; - **run the command (hypertext-mode-setup), which is empty by
;;   default, but may be redefined by the user to contain special
;;   commands (ie. setting local variables like 'outline-regexp')
;;   **NOTE: do not use this option -- it will soon be obsolete.
;; - run anything assigned to 'hypertext-mode-hooks' (obsolete, but
;;   supported for the sake of compatibility).
;;
;; The advantages of this system are threefold.  First, text mode is
;; untouched -- if you had added the new keystroke to `text-mode-map,'
;; possibly using hooks, you would have added it to all text buffers
;; -- here, it appears only in hypertext buffers, where it makes
;; sense.  Second, it is possible to build even further, and make
;; a derived mode from a derived mode.  The commands
;;
;;   (define-derived-mode html-mode hypertext-mode "HTML")
;;   [various key definitions]
;; 
;; will add a new major mode for HTML with very little fuss.
;;
;; Note also the function `derived-mode-class,' which returns the non-derived
;; major mode which a derived mode is based on (ie. NOT necessarily the
;; immediate parent).
;;
;; (derived-mode-class 'text-mode) ==> text-mode
;; (derived-mode-class 'hypertext-mode) ==> text-mode
;; (derived-mode-class 'html-mode) ==> text-mode

(defmacro define-derived-mode (child parent name &optional docstring &rest body)
  "Create a new mode as a variant of an existing mode.

The arguments to this command are as follow:

PARENT:    the name of the command for the parent mode (ie. text-mode).
CHILD:     the name of the command for the derived mode.
NAME:      a string which will appear in the status line (ie. \"Hypertext\")
DOCSTRING: an optional documentation string--if you do not supply one,
           the function will attempt to invent something useful.
BODY:      forms to execute just before running the
           hooks for the new mode.

Here is how you could define LaTeX-Thesis mode as a variant of LaTeX mode:

  (define-derived-mode LaTeX-thesis-mode LaTeX-mode \"LaTeX-Thesis\")

You could then make new key bindings for `LaTeX-thesis-mode-map'
without changing regular LaTeX mode.  In this example, BODY is empty,
and DOCSTRING is generated by default.

On a more complicated level, the following command uses sgml-mode as
the parent, and then sets the variable `case-fold-search' to nil:

  (define-derived-mode article-mode sgml-mode \"Article\"
    \"Major mode for editing technical articles.\"
    (setq case-fold-search nil))

Note that if the documentation string had been left out, it would have
been generated automatically, with a reference to the keymap."

					; appears to be the docstring
					; may really be the first
					; element of the body.
