;; lets keep the summary stuff out until we get it working ..
;;	sundar@hermes.ai.mit.edu Wed Apr 10,1985 at 16:32:06
;; hack slash maim. mly@prep.ai.mit.edu Thu 18 Apr, 1985 06:11:14
;; modified to correct reentrance bug, to not bother with groups that
;;   received no new traffic since last read completely, to find out
;;   what traffic a group has available much more quickly when
;;   possible, to do some completing reads for group names - should
;;   be much faster...
;;	KING@KESTREL.arpa, Thu Mar 13 09:03:28 1986
;; made news-{next,previous}-group skip groups with no new messages; and
;; added checking for unsubscribed groups to news-add-news-group
;;	tower@prep.ai.mit.edu Jul 18 1986
;; bound rmail-output to C-o; and changed header-field commands binding to
;; agree with the new C-c C-f usage in sendmail
;; 	tower@prep Sep  3 1986
;; added news-rotate-buffer-body
;;	tower@prep Oct 17 1986
;; made messages more user friendly, cleanuped news-inews
;; move posting and mail code to new file rnewpost.el
;;	tower@prep Oct 29 1986
;; added caesar-region, rename news-caesar-buffer-body, hacked accordingly
