;;; Commentary:

;; This mode provides an Emacs interface to the UNIX spell(1) program.
;; Entry points are `spell-buffer', `spell-word', `spell-region' and
;; `spell-string'.  These facilities are documented in the Emacs user's
;; manual.

;;; Code:

(defvar spell-command "spell"
  "*Command to run the spell program.")

(defvar spell-filter nil
  "*Filter function to process text before passing it to spell program.
This function might remove text-processor commands.
nil means don't alter the text before checking it.")

;;;###autoload

For each incorrect word, you are asked for the correct spelling
and then put into a query-replace to fix some or all occurrences.
If you do not want to change a word, just give the same word
as its \"correct\" spelling; then the query replace is skipped."
