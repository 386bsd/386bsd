;;; Commentary: ===========================================================
;;
;; This file provides routines for getting the `thing' at the location of
;; point, whatever that `thing' happens to be.  The `thing' is defined by
;; it's beginning and end positions in the buffer.
;;
;; The function bounds-of-thing-at-point finds the beginning and end
;; positions by moving first forward to the end of the `thing', and then
;; backwards to the beginning.  By default, it uses the corresponding
;; forward-`thing' operator (eg. forward-word, forward-line).
;;
;; Special cases are allowed for using properties associated with the named
;; `thing': 
;;
;;   forward-op		Function to call to skip forward over a `thing' (or
;;                      with a negative argument, backward).
;;                      
;;   beginning-op	Function to call to skip to the beginning of a `thing'.
;;   end-op		Function to call to skip to the end of a `thing'.
;;
;; Reliance on existing operators means that many `things' can be accessed
;; without further code:  eg.
;;     (thing-at-point 'line)
;;     (thing-at-point 'page)
