;;; Commentary:

;; Theory: the first time you start Emacs, command line arguments are
;; handled normally.  Then, you suspend your emacs job.  When you want to edit
;; something else, you type "emacs filename" as usual, but instead of
;; starting a new emacs job, the old job is resumed instead, and the command
;; line arguments are placed in a file where the old emacs job looks for
;; them.

;; Stephan Gildea suggested bug fix (gildea@bbn.com).
;; Ideas from Michael DeCorte and other people.

;; For csh users, insert the following alias in your .cshrc file
;; (after removing the leading double semicolons, of course):
;;
;;# The following line could be just EMACS_CMD=emacs, but this depends on
;;# your site.
;;if (! $?EMACS_CMD) set EMACS_CMD=emacs
;;set JOBS_FILE=/tmp/jobs.$USER.$$
;;set ARGS_FILE=~/.emacs_args
;;set STOP_PATT='^\[[0-9]*\] *[ +-] Stopped ............ '
;;set SUNVIEW_CMD='emacstool -nw -f emacstool-init -f server-start'
;;set X_CMD=\'\''$EMACS_CMD -i -f server-start'
;;alias emacs \
;;' \\
;;   jobs >! "$JOBS_FILE" \\
;;   && grep "$STOP_PATT$EMACS_CMD" "$JOBS_FILE" >& /dev/null \\
;;   && echo `pwd` \!* >! "$ARGS_FILE" && ""fg %$EMACS_CMD \\
;;|| if (! -e ~/.emacs_server || -f ~/.emacs_server) set status=1 \\
;;   && emacsclient \!* \\
;;|| @ status=1 - $?DISPLAY && eval "$X_CMD -i \!* &" \\
;;|| @ status=1 - $?WINDOW_PARENT && eval "$SUNVIEW_CMD \!* &" \\
;;|| ""$EMACS_CMD -nw \!* \\
;;'
;;
;; The alias works as follows:
;; 1. If there is a suspended Emacs job that is a child of the
;; current shell, place its arguments in the ~/.emacs_args file and
;; resume it.
;; 2. Else if the ~/.emacs_server socket has been created, presume an
;; Emacs server is running and attempt to connect to it.  If no Emacs
;; server is listening on the socket, this will fail.
;; 3. Else if the DISPLAY environment variable is set, presume we are
;; running under X Windows and start a new GNU Emacs process in the
;; background as an X client.
;; 4. Else if the WINDOW_PARENT environment variable is set, presume we
;; are running under SunView and start an emacstool process in the
;; background.
;; 5. Else start a regular Emacs process.
;;
;; Notes:
;; The output of the "jobs" command is not piped directly into "grep"
;; because that would run the "jobs" command in a subshell.
;; Before resuming a suspended emacs, the current directory and all
;; command line arguments are placed in a file name ~/.emacs_args.
;; The "-nw" switch to Emacs means no windowing system.

;; Insert this in your .emacs file:
;;(add-hook 'suspend-hook 'resume-suspend-hook)

;; Finally, put the rest in a file named "resume.el" in a lisp library
;; directory.
