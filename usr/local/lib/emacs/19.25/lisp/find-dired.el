;; INSTALLATION ======================================================

;; To use this file, byte-compile it, install it somewhere in your
;; load-path, and put:

;;   (autoload 'find-dired "find-dired" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'find-name-dired "find-dired" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'find-grep-dired "find-dired" nil t)

;; in your ~/.emacs, or site-init.el, etc.

;; To bind it to a key, put, e.g.:
;;
;;   (global-set-key "\C-cf" 'find-dired)
;;   (global-set-key "\C-cn" 'find-name-dired)
;;   (global-set-key "\C-cl" 'find-grep-dired)
;;
;; in your ~/.emacs.
