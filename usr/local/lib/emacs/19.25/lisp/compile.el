Each error descriptor is a cons (or nil).  Its car is a marker pointing to
an error message.  If its cdr is a marker, it points to the text of the
line the message is about.  If its cdr is a cons, it is a list
\(\(DIRECTORY . FILE\) LINE [COLUMN]\).  Or its cdr may be nil if that
error is not interesting.

The value may be t instead of a list; this means that the buffer of
error messages should be reparsed the next time the list of errors is wanted.

Some other commands (like `diff') use this list to control the error
message tracking facilites; if you change its structure, you should make
sure you also change those packages.  Perhaps it is better not to change
it at all.")
