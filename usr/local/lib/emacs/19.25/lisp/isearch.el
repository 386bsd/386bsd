;;; Commentary:

;;;====================================================================
;; Instructions

;; For programmed use of isearch-mode, e.g. calling (isearch-forward),
;; isearch-mode behaves modally and does not return until the search
;; is completed.  It uses a recursive-edit to behave this way.  Note:
;; gnus does it wrong: (call-interactively 'isearch-forward).

;; The key bindings active within isearch-mode are defined below in
;; `isearch-mode-map' which is given bindings close to the default
;; characters of the original isearch.el.  With `isearch-mode',
;; however, you can bind multi-character keys and it should be easier
;; to add new commands.  One bug though: keys with meta-prefix cannot
;; be longer than two chars.  Also see minibuffer-local-isearch-map
;; for bindings active during `isearch-edit-string'.

;; Note to emacs version 19 users: isearch-mode should work even if
;; you switch windows with the mouse, in which case isearch-mode is
;; terminated automatically before the switch.  This is true of lemacs
;; too, with a few more cleanups I've neglected in this release. 
;; No one has supplied patches for epoch yet.

;; The search ring and completion commands automatically put you in
;; the minibuffer to edit the string.  This gives you a chance to
;; modify the search string before executing the search.  There are
;; three commands to terminate the editing: C-s and C-r exit the
;; minibuffer and search forward and reverse respectively, while C-m
;; exits and does a nonincremental search.

;; Exiting immediately from isearch uses isearch-edit-string instead
;; of nonincremental-search, if search-nonincremental-instead is non-nil.
;; The name of this option should probably be changed if we decide to
;; keep the behavior.  No point in forcing nonincremental search until
;; the last possible moment.

;; TODO
;; - Integrate the emacs 19 generalized command history.
;; - Think about incorporating query-replace.
;; - Hooks and options for failed search.

;;; Change Log:

;;; Changes before those recorded in ChangeLog:

;;; Revision 1.4  92/09/14  16:26:02  liberte
;;; Added prefix args to isearch-forward, etc. to switch between
;;;    string and regular expression searching.
;;; Added some support for lemacs.
;;; Added general isearch-highlight option - but only for lemacs so far.
;;; Added support for frame switching in emacs 19.
;;; Added word search option to isearch-edit-string.
;;; Renamed isearch-quit to isearch-abort.
;;; Numerous changes to comments and doc strings.
;;; 
;;; Revision 1.3  92/06/29  13:10:08  liberte
;;; Moved modal isearch-mode handling into isearch-mode.
;;; Got rid of buffer-local isearch variables.
;;; isearch-edit-string used by ring adjustments, completion, and
;;; nonincremental searching.  C-s and C-r are additional exit commands.
;;; Renamed all regex to regexp.
;;; Got rid of found-start and found-point globals.
;;; Generalized handling of upper-case chars.
 
;;; Revision 1.2  92/05/27  11:33:57  liberte
;;; Emacs version 19 has a search ring, which is supported here.
;;; Other fixes found in the version 19 isearch are included here.
;;;
;;; Also see variables search-caps-disable-folding,
;;; search-nonincremental-instead, search-whitespace-regexp, and
;;; commands isearch-toggle-regexp, isearch-edit-string.
;;;
;;; semi-modal isearching is supported.

;;; Changes for 1.1
;;; 3/18/92 Fixed invalid-regexp.
;;; 3/18/92 Fixed yanking in regexps.

;;; Code:

;;; Emacs features

;; isearch-mode takes advantage of the features provided by several
;; different versions of emacs.  Rather than testing the version of
;; emacs, several constants are defined, one for each of the features.
;; Each of the tests below must work on any version of emacs.
;; (Perhaps provide and featurep could be used for this purpose.)
