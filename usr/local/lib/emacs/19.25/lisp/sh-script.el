  "Major mode for editing shell scripts.
This mode works for many shells, since they all have roughly the same syntax,
as far as commands, arguments, variables, pipes, comments etc. are concerned.
Unless the file's magic number indicates the shell, your usual shell is
assumed.  Since filenames rarely give a clue, they are not further analyzed.

The syntax of the statements varies with the shell being used.  The syntax of
statements can be modified by putting a property on the command or new ones
defined with `define-sh-skeleton'.  For example

    (put 'sh-until 'ksh '(() \"until \" _ \\n > \"do\" \\n \"done\"))
or
    (put 'sh-if 'smush '(\"What? \" \"If ya got ( \" str \" ) ya betta { \" _ \" }\"))

where `sh-until' or `sh-if' have been or will be defined by `define-sh-skeleton'.

The following commands are available, based on the current shell's syntax:

\\[sh-case]	 case statement
\\[sh-for]	 for loop
\\[sh-function]	 function definition
\\[sh-if]	 if statement
\\[sh-indexed-loop]	 indexed loop from 1 to n
\\[sh-select]	 select statement
\\[sh-until]	 until loop
\\[sh-while]	 while loop

\\[backward-delete-char-untabify]	 Delete backward one position, even if it was a tab.
\\[sh-newline-and-indent]	 Delete unquoted space and indent new line same as this one.
\\[sh-end-of-command]	 Go to end of successive commands.
\\[sh-beginning-of-command]	 Go to beginning of successive commands.
\\[sh-set-shell]	 Set this buffer's shell, and maybe its magic number.
\\[sh-manual-entry]	 Display the Unix manual entry for the current command or shell.

\\[sh-query-for-variable]	 Unless quoted with \\, query for a variable with completions offered.
\\[sh-maybe-here-document]	 Without prefix, following an unquoted < inserts here document.
{, (, [, ', \", `
	Unless quoted with \\, insert the pairs {}, (), [], or '', \"\", ``."
