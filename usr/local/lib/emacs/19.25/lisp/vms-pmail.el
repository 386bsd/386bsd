;;; Code:

;;;
;;; Quick hack to use emacs as mail editor.  There are a *bunch* of
;;; changes scattered throughout emacs to make this work, namely:
;;; (1) mod to sysdep.c to allow emacs to attach to a process other
;;;     than the one that originally spawned it.
;;; (2) mod to kepteditor.com to define the logical emacs_parent_pid
;;;     which is what sysdep.c looks for, and define the logical
;;;     emacs_command_args which contains the command line
;;; (3) mod to re-parse command line arguments from emacs_command_args
;;;     then execute them as though emacs were just starting up.
