;;; Commentary:

;;; This Lisp code is run in Emacs when it is to operate as
;;; a server for other processes.

;;; Load this library and do M-x server-edit to enable Emacs as a server.
;;; Emacs runs the program ../arch-lib/emacsserver as a subprocess
;;; for communication with clients.  If there are no client buffers to edit, 
;;; server-edit acts like (switch-to-buffer (other-buffer))

;;; When some other program runs "the editor" to edit a file,
;;; "the editor" can be the Emacs client program ../lib-src/emacsclient.
;;; This program transmits the file names to Emacs through
;;; the server subprocess, and Emacs visits them and lets you edit them.

;;; Note that any number of clients may dispatch files to emacs to be edited.

;;; When you finish editing a Server buffer, again call server-edit
;;; to mark that buffer as done for the client and switch to the next 
;;; Server buffer.  When all the buffers for a client have been edited 
;;; and exited with server-edit, the client "editor" will return
;;; to the program that invoked it.  

;;; Your editing commands and Emacs's display output go to and from
;;; the terminal in the usual way.  Thus, server operation is possible
;;; only when Emacs can talk to the terminal at the time you invoke
;;; the client.  This is possible in four cases:

;;; 1. On a window system, where Emacs runs in one window and the
;;; program that wants to use "the editor" runs in another.

;;; 2. On a multi-terminal system, where Emacs runs on one terminal and the
;;; program that wants to use "the editor" runs on another.

;;; 3. When the program that wants to use "the editor" is running
;;; as a subprocess of Emacs.

;;; 4. On a system with job control, when Emacs is suspended, the program
;;; that wants to use "the editor" will stop and display
;;; "Waiting for Emacs...".  It can then be suspended, and Emacs can be
;;; brought into the foreground for editing.  When done editing, Emacs is
;;; suspended again, and the client program is brought into the foreground.

;;; The buffer local variable "server-buffer-clients" lists 
;;; the clients who are waiting for this buffer to be edited.  
;;; The global variable "server-clients" lists all the waiting clients,
;;; and which files are yet to be edited for each.
