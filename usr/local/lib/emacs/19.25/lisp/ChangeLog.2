Tue Jan 19 14:03:23 1988  Chris Hanson  (cph at sugar-smacks)

	* xscheme.el: Extensive changes including better documentation, a
	new major mode `scheme-debugger-mode', and a new format for the
	modeline when using the Scheme interface.

	The major mode `scheme-debugger-mode' is used when Scheme is
	running one of the character-driven debugger interfaces.  It is
	like Scheme mode except that evaluation is disabled, and
	characters that are normally self-inserting instead are
	transmitted to the Scheme process.

	The modeline is changed so that information about the state of the
	Scheme process is shown only in buffers whose major mode is
	`scheme-mode' or one of the related Scheme major modes.
	Information about the state of the read-eval-print loop is shown
	only in the Scheme process buffer.

	All of these changes are upwards compatible with versions of
	Scheme which ran using the previous interface.  However, some of
	the features will not be enabled in older Scheme systems.  Newer
	versions of Scheme (specifically, those newer than release 6.1.1)
	require the new interface for correct operation.  They will not
	work correctly with older version of this interface.

	* scheme.el: Minor changes to support "xscheme.el" changes.
	Mostly this involved adding hooks to existing facilities.

Tue Jan 19 05:07:25 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes)

	Eliminate the loop to delete such spaces.

	* rmail.el (rmail-set-attribute): Expect and write spaces before labels.

Wed Dec 23 17:24:16 1987  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at peduncle)

Sun Dec  6 01:22:27 1987  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes)

	* compile.el (compilation-error-regexp): Last alternative
	could match spuriously; change `.*' to ` *'.  Change may be wrong;
	nobody knows which program makes error messages this should match.

	* terminal.el: Many fixes: some new termcap entries and fix bugs
	in others.

	Terminal width and height may be specified.
	Scrolling is now the default.  Enabling or disabling scrolling
	during use does not really work because it is necessary to change
	the termcap entry.

	Do `stty new dec' at startup.  Without this, you get printing
	terminal echoing which looks very strange with DEL as the erase
	char.  This may lose on sysV, but the need can't be ignored.

	One known bug remains a mystery: when running `ex', the empty-line
	command fails to overprint the colon with the text that is
	printed.  The output Emacs receives contains a crlf in place of a cr.

	* startup.el (command-line-1): Don't insert the startup-message
	in a buffer other than *scratch*.  Fixes bug with (rmail) in .emacs.

	* files.el (save-buffer): Don't make a backup if arg is 0.

	decide whether to call dired.

	* rmail.el (rmail): If buffer already existed and find-file

	Add new variable `rmail-default-dont-reply-to-names' which is used
	(together with the user's name) as the default value of
	rmail-dont-reply-to-names.  This variable replaces the wired-in
	constant "info-" in `rmail-dont-reply-to' and is intended to be
	used in the site-init.el file -- eg "all-ai\\>\\|[0-9]ai\\>\\|info-"

	clear screen, redisplay, and ask again.

	* isearch.el: In regexp isearch, when a ?, * or | is input,

	Add batch-texinfo-format

	* startup.el
	Add synonym switches "-funcall" "-load" "-user" "-no-init-file"

	* mlsupport.el
	Make various turds know that inhibit-command-line has gone.

	* bytecomp.el (batch-byte-compile), tex-start.el
	Because of RMS's change "Mon Jul  7 14:01:51 1986"
	must use variable command-line-args-left rather than command-line-args.

	Actually, I see no circumstances under which a switch -could- be
	interested in any command-line-args before the mention of itself,
	and so think that rebinding command-line-args as appropriate was
	correct (if perhaps a little confusing to the person who requested
	that RMS' change be made)
