This file, readme.doc, describes problems and new features in the
current release of Ghostscript.  This file describes version 2.6.1 of
Ghostscript.

For an overview of Ghostscript and a list of the documentation files, see
README.

New features
============

Note: this is not a complete list of new features.  See the most recent
section of NEWS for full details.

Handling of both color and platform fonts under X Windows is greatly
improved.  See the X Windows section of use.doc for details.

A new document, commprod.doc, clarifies the requirements for being
able to distribute Ghostscript in conjunction with commercial
products.

Known problems
==============

Interpreter
-----------

The interactive interpreter requires that every statement fit on a line,
i.e., you can't have an unpaired ( or {.

On a MS-DOS system, interrupting Ghostscript by typing ^C doesn't restore
the display mode.

Operators
---------

The Ghostscript language does not include the following operators of the
PostScript language:

	resetfile
	banddevice, renderbands (these are obsolete)

The following are not implemented completely:

	%statementedit (file name): interpreted as equivalent to
%lineedit.

The following operators that expect arrays won't accept packed arrays:
	definefont (Subrs (type 1 fonts))
	setdash (dash pattern)
	setcachedevice (bounding box)
	makeimagedevice (palette)

Limitations
-----------

Floating point exceptions terminate Ghostscript, rather than producing a
rangecheck error.

copypage does nothing in the MS-DOS implementation, and merely
synchronizes the X connection in the Unix implementation.  showpage is a
procedure that does a copypage and then beeps the bell and waits for the
user to hit a key. (copypage does do the right thing for printers.)

Graphics bugs
-------------

strokepath may produce incorrect output for dashed lines.

The implementation only looks at the PaintType of the font when doing
show, not when doing charpath.  Because of this, stroked fonts don't work
correctly with charpath.

arcto gives an error for negative radii.

Halftone patterns "flip over" at the 50% coverage point, producing
anomalous visual effects on some color devices.

Opening more than one window device at the same time doesn't work.
This is the case for both X Windows and Microsoft Windows.

glyphshow only works with Type 1 fonts.

Non-graphics bugs
-----------------

restore doesn't properly undo currentgstate.

Copying a dictionary may alter some items even if a later item causes
an invalidaccess error because of an attempted store of a local
object into global VM.
