/*
 * The following routines are somewhat easier to use that the above.
 * The user declares a variable of type STACKSTR, which may be declared
 * to be a register.  The macro STARTSTACKSTR initializes things.  Then
 * the user uses the macro STPUTC to add characters to the string.  In
 * effect, STPUTC(c, p) is the same as *p++ = c except that the stack is
 * grown as necessary.  When the user is done, she can just leave the
 * string there and refer to it using stackblock().  Or she can allocate
 * the space for it using grabstackstr().  If it is necessary to allow
 * someone else to use the stack temporarily and then continue to grow
 * the string, the user should use grabstack to allocate the space, and
 * then call ungrabstr(p) to return to the previous mode of operation.
 *
 * USTPUTC is like STPUTC except that it doesn't check for overflow.
 * CHECKSTACKSPACE can be called before USTPUTC to ensure that there
 * is space for at least one character.
