.Sh NAME
.Nm ls
.Nd list directory contents.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ls
.Op Fl CFRacdilqrstu1
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
For each operand that names a
.Ar file
of a type other than
directory,
.Nm ls
displays its name as well as any requested,
associated information.
For each operand that names a
.Ar file
of type directory,
.Nm ls
displays the names of files contained
within that directory, as well as any requested, associated
information.
.Pp
If no operands are given, the contents of the current
directory are displayed.
If more than one operand is given,
non-directory operands are displayed first; directory
and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in
lexicographical order.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A
List all entries except for
.Ql \&.
and
.Ql \&.. .
Always set for the super-user.
.It Fl C
Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to a terminal.
.It Fl F
Display a slash (/) immediately after each pathname
that is a directory, an asterisk (*) after each that is
executable,
and an at sign (@) after each symbolic link.
.\"and a vertical bar (|) after
.\"each that is a
.\".Tn FIFO . 
.It Fl L
If argument is a symbolic link, list the file or directory the link references
rather than the link itself.
.It Fl R
Recursively list subdirectories encountered.
.It Fl T
Display complete time information for the file, including
month, day, hour, minute, second, and year.
.It Fl a
Include directory entries whose names begin with a
dot (.).
.It Fl c
Use time when file status was last changed for sorting or printing.
.It Fl d
Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).
.It Fl f
Output is not sorted.
.It Fl g
Include the group ownership of the file in a long
.Pq Fl l
output
.Pq Fl lg .
If the group is not a known group name, the numeric ID
is printed.
.It Fl i
For each file, print the file's file serial number (inode number).
.It Fl k
Modifies the
.Fl s
option, causing the sizes to be reported in kilobytes.
.It Fl l
(The lowercase letter ``ell.'')  List in long format. (See below.)
If the output is to a terminal, a total sum for all the file
sizes is output on a line before the long listing.
.It Fl q
Force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as
the character `?'; this is the default when output is to a terminal.
.It Fl r
Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse
lexicographical order or the oldest entries first.
.It Fl s
Display the number of file system bytes actually
used by each file, in units of 512, where partial
units are rounded up to the next integer value.
If the output is to a terminal, a total sum for all the file
sizes is output on a line before the listing.
.It Fl t
Sort by time modified (most recently modified
first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical
order.
.It Fl u
Use time of last access,
instead of last modification
of the file for sorting
.Pq Fl t
or printing
.Pq Fl l .
.It Fl \&1
(The numeric digit ``one.'')  Force output to be
one entry per line.
This is the default when
output is not to a terminal.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl 1 ,
.Fl C ,
and
.Fl l
options all override each other; the last one specified determines
the format used.
.Pp
The
.Fl c ,
and
.Fl u
options override each other; the last one specified determines
the file time used.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm ls
lists one entry per line to standard
output; the exceptions are to terminals or when the
.Fl C
option is specified.
.Pp
File information is displayed with one or more
<blank>s separating the information associated with the
.Fl i ,
.Fl s ,
and
.Fl l
options.
.Ss The Long Format
If the
.Fl l
option is given, the following information
is be displayed:
file mode,
number of links, owner name,
.\" group name,
number of bytes in the file, abbreviated
month, day-of-month file was last modified,
hour file last modified, minute file last
modified, and the pathname.
.Pp
If the owner name is not a known user name
the numeric ID is displayed.
.Pp
If the file is a character special or block special file,
the major and minor device numbers for the file are displayed
in the size field. If the file is a symbolic link the pathname of the
linked-to file is preceded by
.Dq \-> .
.Pp
The file mode printed under the -l option consists of the
the entry type, owner permissions, and group permissions.
The entry type character describes the type of file, as
follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 4n -offset indent -compact
.It Sy b
Block special file.
.It Sy c
Character special file.
.It Sy d
Directory.
.It Sy l
Symbolic link.
.It Sy s
Socket link.
.\" .It Sy p
.\" .Tn FIFO .
.It Sy \-
Regular file.
.El
.Pp
The next three fields
are three characters each:
owner permissions,
group permissions, and
other permissions.
Each field has three character positions:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
If
.Sy r ,
the file is readable; if
.Sy \- ,
it is not readable.
.It
If
.Sy w ,
the file is writable; if
.Sy \- ,
it is not writable.
.It
The first of the following that applies:
.Bl -tag -width 4n -offset indent
.It Sy S
If in the owner permissions, the file is not executable and
set-user-ID mode is set.
If in the group permissions, the file is not executable
and set-group-ID mode is set.
.It Sy s
If in the owner permissions, the file is executable
and set-user-ID mode is set.
If in the group permissions, the file is executable
and setgroup-ID mode is set.
.It Sy x
The file is executable or the directory is
searchable.
.It Sy \-
The file is neither readable, writeable, exectutable,
or set-user-ID or set-group-ID mode nor sticky. (See below.)
.El
.Pp
These next two apply only to the third character in the last group
(other permissions).
.Bl -tag -width 4n -offset indent
.It Sy T
The sticky bit is set
(mode
.Li 1000 ) ,
but not execute or search permission. (See
.Xr chmod 1
or
.Xr sticky 8 . )
.It Sy t
The sticky bit is set (mode
.Li 1000 ) ,
and is searcheable or executable.
(See
.Xr chmod 1
or
.Xr sticky 8 . )
.El
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm ls
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm ls :
.Bl -tag -width COLUMNS
.It COLUMNS
If this variable contains a string representing a
decimal integer, it is used as the
column position width for displaying
multiple-text-column output.
The
.Nm ls
utility calculates how
many pathname text columns to display
based on the width provided.

.Fl C . )
