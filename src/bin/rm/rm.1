.Sh NAME
.Nm rm
.Nd Remove directory entries.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rm
.Op Fl f | Fl i
.Op Fl dRr
.Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm rm
utility attempts to remove the non-directory type files specified on the
command line.
If the permissions of the file do not permit writing, and the standard
input device is a terminal, the user is prompted (on the standard error
output) for confirmation.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl d
Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.
.It Fl f
Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation,
regardless of the file's permissions.
If the file does not exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify
the exit status to reflect an error.
The
.Fl f
option overrides any previous
.Fl i 
options.
.It Fl i
Request confirmation before attempting to remove each file, regardless of
the file's permissions, or whether or not the standard input device is a
terminal.
The
.Fl i
option overrides any previous
.Fl f 
options.
.It Fl R
Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument.
The 
.Fl R
option implies the
.Fl d
option.
If the
.Fl i
option is specified, the user is prompted for confirmation before 
each directory's contents are processed (as well as before the attempt
is made to remove the directory).
If the user does not respond affirmatively, the file hierarchy rooted in
that directory is skipped.
.Pp
.It Fl r
Equivalent to
.Fl R .
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm rm
utility removes symbolic links, not the files referenced by the links.
.Pp
It is an error to attempt to remove the files ``.'' and ``..''.
.Pp
The
.Nm rm
utility exits 0 if all of the named files or file hierarchies were removed,
or if the
.Fl f
option was specified and all of the existing files or file hierarchies were
removed.
If an error occurs,
.Nm rm
exits with a value >0.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rmdir 1 ,
.Xr unlink 2 ,
.Xr fts 3
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm rm
utility differs from historical implementations in that the
.Fl f
option only masks attempts to remove non-existent files instead of
masking a large variety of errors.
.Pp
Also, historical
.Bx
implementations prompted on the standard output,
not the standard error output.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm rm
command is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
