.Dt DOSFS 4
.Os 386BSD 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm dosfs
.Nd MS-DOS FAT file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm dosfs fs_idx.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr dosfs 4
filesystem provides support for a MS DOS formatted hard disk partition or
floppy disk to be mounted on the system's filesystem tree, allowing DOS
files to be directly accessible by all user programs.
.Pp
Since DOS file and directory names and attributes do not correspond to
POSIX names and attributes, the filesystem implementation partially compensates
for these limitations for the convienence of the user. File and directory
names are silently truncated and case-wrapped to 7 character lowercase
characters and numbers (11 if the 8th is a period). While the names are
recorded internally as upper case only, case is always mapped to lower
case on filename lookup and creation. Filenames ending in a period have
the period silently dropped as well. Files can only be made "system read
only" regardless of user, as only the single write bit per file is present
(the hidden and archived attribute bits are not implemented). While all
files appear to be owned by root, any user can alter contents and attributes
at will (so the only protection present is that of the mount directory itself).
Read and execute attribute bits are always set for user, group, and other.
The write protect attribute bit can only be set from the user set (where
it will appear to set them all).
.Pp
In addition, all time attributes reported are always the time of last
modification. Since times are kept in local time, times fitfully correspond
to DOS interpretations.
