/*
 * Name caching works as follows:
 *
 * Names found by directory scans are retained in a cache
 * for future reference.  It is managed LRU, so frequently
 * used names will hang around.  Cache is indexed by hash value
 * obtained from (vp, name) where vp refers to the directory
 * containing name.
 *
 * For simplicity (and economy of storage), names longer than
 * a maximum length of NCHNAMLEN are not cached; they occur
 * infrequently in any case, and are almost never of interest.
 *
 * Upon reaching the last segment of a path, if the reference
 * is for DELETE, or NOCACHE is set (rewrite), and the
 * name is located in the cache, it will be dropped.
