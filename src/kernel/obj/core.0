     A small number of signals which cause abnormal termination of a process
     also cause a record of the process's in-core state to be written to disk
     for later examination by one of the aviailable debuggers.  (See
     sigaction(2).)  This memory image is written to a file named
     pprrooggnnaammee..ccoorree in the working directory, where progname is replaced by the
     name of the program; provided the terminated process had write permission
     in the directory, the filesystem on which the working directory is on was
     not mounted with the option _n_o_c_o_r_e (See mount(8)),  and provided the
     abnormality did not cause a system crash.  (In this event, the decision
     to save the core file is arbitrary, see savecore(8).)

     The maximum size of a ccoorree file is limited by setrlimit(2).  Files which
     would be larger than the limit are not created.  Also, the kernel tries
     hard to not overwrite an existing file unless it is in standard coredump
     format and was produced from the same program.

     The ccoorree file consists of the _u. area, whose size (in pages) is defined
     by the UPAGES manifest in the <_s_y_s/_p_a_r_a_m._h> file.  The _u. area starts
     with a _u_s_e_r structure as given in <_s_y_s/_u_s_e_r._h>. The remainder of the ccoorree
     file consists of the data pages followed by the stack pages of the
     process image.  The amount of data space image in the ccoorree file is given
     (in pages) by the variable _u__d_s_i_z_e in the _u. area.  The amount of stack
     image in the core file is given (in pages) by the variable _u__s_s_i_z_e in the
     _u. area.  The size of a ``page'' is given by the constant NBPG (also from
     <_s_y_s/_p_a_r_a_m._h>).
