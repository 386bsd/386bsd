     mmeemm, kkmmeemm - memory files

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The special file //ddeevv//mmeemm is an interface to the physical memory of the
     computer.  Byte offsets in this file are interpreted as physical memory
     addresses.  Reading and writing this file is equivalent to reading and
     writing memory itself.  Only offsets within the bounds of //ddeevv//mmeemm are
     allowed.

     Kernel virtual memory is accessed through the interface //ddeevv//kkmmeemm in the
     same manner as //ddeevv//mmeemm. Only kernel virtual addresses that are currently
     mapped to memory are allowed.

     On ISA the I/O memory space begins at physical address 0x000a0000 and
     runs to 0x00100000.  The kernel virtual address space (usually) starts at
     address 0xfe000000, and each process/thread kernel stack is uniquely
     located in the kernel heap above the kernel program.
