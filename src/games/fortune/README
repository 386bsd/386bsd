The potentially offensive fortunes are not installed by default on BSD
systems.  If you're absolutely, *positively*, without-a-shadow-of-a-doubt
sure that your user community wants them installed, change the symbolic
link "datfiles/fortunes-o" to point to "datfiles/fortunes-o.real.rot13",
and do a make, followed by a make install.
