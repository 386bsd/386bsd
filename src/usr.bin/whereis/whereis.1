.Sh NAME
.Nm whereis
.Nd locate binary, manual, and or source for program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm whereis
.Op Fl bms
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl BMS Ar dir Ar ... Fl f
.Ar name Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Whereis
locates source/binary and manuals sections for specified files.
The supplied names are first stripped of leading pathname components
and of any (single) trailing extension of the form
.Ql .ext ,
e.g. 
.Ql \&.c .
Prefixes of
.Ql \&.s
resulting from use of source code control are also
dealt with.
.Nm Whereis
then attempts to locate the desired program in a list of standard places.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B
Change or limit directories searched for binaries. Requires the
.Fl f
flag.
.It Fl M
Change or limit directories searched for manual entries. Requires the
.Fl f
flag.
.It Fl S
Change or limit directories searched for source. Requires the
.Fl f
flag.
.It Fl b
Search for binaries.
.It Fl f
Signals the end of a directory list specified by one or more of the
.Fl B , M
or
.Fl S
options and the start of file
.Ar names .
.It Fl m
Search for manual entries.
.It Fl s
Search for source.
.It Fl u
Search for unusual entries.
A file is said to be unusual if it does not have one entry of
each requested type.
Thus:
.Pp
.Dl whereis -m -u *
.Pp
asks for those files in the current
directory which have no documentation.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLE
The following finds all the files in
.Pa /usr/bin
which are not documented
in
.Pa /usr/share/man/man1
with source in
.Pa /usr/src/cmd:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
cd /usr/ucb
whereis \-u \-M /usr/share/man/man1 \-S /usr/src/cmd \-f *
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /lib,x/etc,x/usr/{lib,bin,ucb,old,new,local} -compact
.It Pa /usr/src/*
.It Pa /usr/{doc,man}/*
.It Pa /lib, /etc, /usr/{lib,bin,ucb,old,new,local}
.El
.Sh BUGS
Since the program uses
.Xr chdir 2
to run faster, pathnames given with the
.Fl M
.Fl S
and
.Fl B
must be full; i.e. they must begin with a
.Ql \&/ .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
