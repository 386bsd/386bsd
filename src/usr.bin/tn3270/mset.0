     MMsseett retrieves mapping information for the ASCII keyboard to IBM 3270
     terminal special functions.  Normally, these mappings are found in
     /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_m_i_s_c/_m_a_p_3_2_7_0 (see map3270(5)).  This information is used by
     the tn3270 command (see tn3270(1)).

     The default mmsseett output can be used to store the mapping information in
     the process environment in order to avoid scanning mmaapp33227700 each time
     ttnn33227700 is invoked.  To do this, place the following command in your
     ._l_o_g_i_n file:

           set noglob; setenv MAP3270 "`mset`"; unset noglob

     If the _k_e_y_b_o_a_r_d_n_a_m_e argument is not supplied, mmsseett attempts to determine
     the name of the keyboard the user is using, by checking the KEYBD envi-
     ronment variable.  If the KEYBD environment variable is not set, then
     mmsseett uses the user's terminal type from the environment variable TERM as
     the keyboard name.  Normally, mmsseett then uses the file map3270(5) to find
     the keyboard mapping for that terminal.  However, if the environment
     variable MAP3270 exists and contains the entry for the specified key-
     board, then that definition is used.  If the value of MAP3270 begins with
     a slash (`/') then it is assumed to be the full pathname of an alternate
     mapping file and that file is searched first.  In any case, if the map-
     ping for the keyboard is not found in the environment, nor in an alter-
     nate map file, nor in the standard map file, then the same search is per-
     formed for an entry for a keyboard with the name _u_n_k_n_o_w_n. If that search
     also fails, then a default mapping is used.

     The arguments to mmsseett are:

     --ppiicckkyy      When processing the various _m_a_p_3_2_7_0 entries (for the user's
                 keyboard, and all those encountered before the one for the
                 user's keyboard), mmsseett normally will not complain about en-
                 tries for unknown functions (like ``PFX1''; the --ppiicckkyy argu-
                 ment causes mmsseett to issue warning messages about these un-
                 known entries.

     --sshheellll      If the _m_a_p_3_2_7_0 entry is longer than the shell's 1024 environ-
                 mental variable length limit, the default mmsseett output cannot
                 be used to store the mapping information in the process envi-
                 ronment to avoid scanning _m_a_p_3_2_7_0 each time ttnn33227700 is in-
                 voked.  The --sshheellll argument causes mmsseett to generate shell
                 commands to set the environmental variables MAP3270,
                 MAP3270A, and so on, breaking up the entry to fit within the
                 shell environmental variable length limit.  To set these
                 variables, place the following command in your ._l_o_g_i_n file:

                       mset -shell > tmp ; source tmp ; /bin/rm tmp

     _k_e_y_b_o_a_r_d_n_a_m_e
                 When searching for the _m_a_p_3_2_7_0 entry that matches the user's
                 keyboard, mmsseett will use _k_e_y_b_o_a_r_d_n_a_m_e instead of determining
                 the keyboard name from the KEYBD or TERM environmental vari-
                 ables.
