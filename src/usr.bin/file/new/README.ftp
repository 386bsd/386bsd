This directory has two files, dist.src and dist.magic.
They are both shar (shell archive) files; to unpack, just
run them through /bin/sh. 

dist.src contains only the source code, Makefile, and various odds and ends.

dist.magic contains only the pieces to make up /etc/magic.

See README, LEGAL.NOTICE, and PORTING for more information.
