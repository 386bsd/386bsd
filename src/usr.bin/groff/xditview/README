This is gxditview, a X11 previewer for groff based on MIT's xditview.
This version can be used with the output of gtroff -Tps as well as
with -TX75 and -TX100.  You will need X11R5 to install it (it might
work on X11R4, but I haven't tested it.)

See the file INSTALL in this directory for installation instructions.

xditview is copyrighted by MIT under the usual X terms (see
gxditview.man); my changes to it are in the public domain.

Please report bugs to bug-groff@prep.ai.mit.edu.
