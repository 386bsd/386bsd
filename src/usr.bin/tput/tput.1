.Sh NAME
.Nm tput
.Nd terminal capability interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tput
.Op Fl T Ar term
.Ar attribute
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Tput
makes terminal-dependent information available to users or shell
applications.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl T
The terminal name as specified in the
.Xr termcap
database, for example, ``vt100'' or ``xterm''.
If not specified,
.Nm tput
retrieves the
.Dq Ev TERM
variable from the environment.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Tput
outputs a string if the
.Ar attribute
is of type string; a number if it is of type integer.
Otherwise,
.Nm tput
exits 0 if the terminal has the capability and 1 if it does not,
without further action.
.Pp
The following special attributes are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar clear
Clear the screen (the
.Xr termcap
``cl'' sequence).
.It Ar init
Initialize the terminal (the
.Xr termcap
``is'' sequence).
.It Ar longname
Print the descriptive name of the user's terminal type.
.It Ar reset
Reset the terminal (the
.Xr termcap
``rs'' sequence).
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The exit value of
.Nm tput
is based on the last attribute specified.
If the attribute is of type string or of type integer,
.Nm tput
exits 0 if the attribute is defined for this terminal type and 1
if it is not.
If the attribute is of type boolean,
.Nm tput
exits 0 if the terminal has this attribute, and 1 if it does not.
.Nm Tput
exits 2 if any error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr termcap 3 ,
.Xr termcap 5
.Sh BUGS
.Nm Tput
can't really distinguish between different types of attributes.
This is due to the limited interface in the current version of
.Xr termcap 3 ,
and will be fixed in the near future.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command is
.Ud .
