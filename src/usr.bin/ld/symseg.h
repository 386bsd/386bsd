/* Format of GDB symbol table data.
   There is one symbol segment for each source file or
   independant compilation.  These segments are simply concatenated
   to form the GDB symbol table.  A zero word where the beginning
   of a segment is expected indicates there are no more segments.

Format of a symbol segment:

   The symbol segment begins with a word containing 1
   if it is in the format described here.  Other formats may
   be designed, with other code numbers.

   The segment contains many objects which point at each other.
   The pointers are offsets in bytes from the beginning of the segment.
   Thus, each segment can be loaded into core and its pointers relocated
   to make valid in-core pointers.

   All the data objects in the segment can be found indirectly from
   one of them, the root object, of type `struct symbol_root'.
   It appears at the beginning of the segment.

   The total size of the segment, in bytes, appears as the `length'
   field of this object.  This size includes the size of the
   root object.

   All the object data types are defined here to contain pointer types
   appropriate for in-core use on a relocated symbol segment.
   Casts to and from type int are required for working with
   unrelocated symbol segments such as are found in the file.

   The ldsymaddr word is filled in by the loader to contain
   the offset (in bytes) within the ld symbol table
   of the first nonglobal symbol from this compilation.
   This makes it possible to match those symbols
   (which contain line number information) reliably with
   the segment they go with.

   Core addresses within the program that appear in the symbol segment
   are not relocated by the loader.  They are inserted by the assembler
   and apply to addresses as output by the assembler, so GDB must
   relocate them when it loads the symbol segment.  It gets the information
   on how to relocate from the textrel, datarel, bssrel, databeg and bssbeg
   words of the root object.

   The words textrel, datarel and bssrel
   are filled in by ld with the amounts to relocate within-the-file
   text, data and bss addresses by; databeg and bssbeg can be
   used to tell which kind of relocation an address needs.  */
