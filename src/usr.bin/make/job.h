 * Job Table definitions. 
 *
 * Each job has several things associated with it:
 *	1) The process id of the child shell
 *	2) The graph node describing the target being made by this job
 *	3) A LstNode for the first command to be saved after the job
 *	   completes. This is NILLNODE if there was no "..." in the job's
 *	   commands.
 *	4) An FILE* for writing out the commands. This is only
 *	   used before the job is actually started.
 *	5) A union of things used for handling the shell's output. Different
 *	   parts of the union are used based on the value of the usePipes
 *	   flag. If it is true, the output is being caught via a pipe and
 *	   the descriptors of our pipe, an array in which output is line
 *	   buffered and the current position in that buffer are all
 *	   maintained for each job. If, on the other hand, usePipes is false,
 *	   the output is routed to a temporary file and all that is kept
 *	   is the name of the file and the descriptor open to the file.
 *	6) An identifier provided by and for the exclusive use of the
 *	   Rmt module.
 *	7) A word of flags which determine how the module handles errors,
 *	   echoing, etc. for the job 
 *
 * The job "table" is kept as a linked Lst in 'jobs', with the number of
 * active jobs maintained in the 'nJobs' variable. At no time will this
 * exceed the value of 'maxJobs', initialized by the Job_Init function. 
 *
 * When a job is finished, the Make_Update function is called on each of the
 * parents of the node which was just remade. This takes care of the upward
 * traversal of the dependency graph.

/*-
 * Shell Specifications:
 * Each shell type has associated with it the following information:
 *	1) The string which must match the last character of the shell name
 *	   for the shell to be considered of this type. The longest match
 *	   wins.
 *	2) A command to issue to turn off echoing of command lines
 *	3) A command to issue to turn echoing back on again
 *	4) What the shell prints, and its length, when given the echo-off
 *	   command. This line will not be printed when received from the shell
 *	5) A boolean to tell if the shell has the ability to control
 *	   error checking for individual commands.
 *	6) The string to turn this checking on.
 *	7) The string to turn it off.
 *	8) The command-flag to give to cause the shell to start echoing
 *	   commands right away.
 *	9) The command-flag to cause the shell to Lib_Exit when an error is
 *	   detected in one of the commands.
 *
 * Some special stuff goes on if a shell doesn't have error control. In such
 * a case, errCheck becomes a printf template for echoing the command,
 * should echoing be on and ignErr becomes another printf template for
 * executing the command while ignoring the return status. If either of these
 * strings is empty when hasErrCtl is FALSE, the command will be executed
 * anyway as is and if it causes an error, so be it.
