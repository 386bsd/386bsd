.Sh NAME
.Nm ranlib
.Nd table-of-contents for archive libraries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ranlib
.Op Fl t
.Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Ranlib
creates a table of external references for archive libraries,
normally used by the loader,
.Xr ld 1 .
This table is is named ``__.SYMDEF'' and is prepended to the archive.
Files in the archive which are not executable and symbols which are
uninteresting to the loader are ignored.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl t
Set the modification time of the __.SYMDEF file.
This time is compared by the loader with the modification time of the
archive to verify that the table is up-to-date with respect to the
archive.
If the modification time has been changed without any change to the
archive (for example, by a
.Xr cp 1 ) ,
the
.Fl t
option can be used to ``touch'' the modification time so that it
appears that the table is up-to-date.
This is also useful after using the
.Fl t
option of
.Xr make 1 .
