/*
 * BUGS, GRIPES, APOLOGIA etc.
 *
 * A typical user doesn't need ALL this: I intend to make a library out
 * of it one day - Dean Elsner.
 * Also, I want to change the definition of a symbol to (address,length)
 * so I can put arbitrary binary in the names stored. [see hsh.c for that]
 *
 * This slime is common coupled inside the module. Com-coupling (and other
 * vandalism) was done to speed running time. The interfaces at the
 * module's edges are adequately clean.
 *
 * There is no way to (a) run a test script through this heap and (b)
 * compare results with previous scripts, to see if we have broken any
 * code. Use GNU (f)utilities to do this. A few commands assist test.
 * The testing is awkward: it tries to be both batch & interactive.
 * For now, interactive rules!
 */

/*
 *  The idea is to implement a symbol table. A test jig is here.
 *  Symbols are arbitrary strings; they can't contain '\0'.
 *	[See hsh.c for a more general symbol flavour.]
 *  Each symbol is associated with a char*, which can point to anything
 *  you want, allowing an arbitrary property list for each symbol.
 *
 *  The basic operations are:
 *
 *    new                     creates symbol table, returns handle
 *    find (symbol)           returns char*
 *    insert (symbol,char*)   error if symbol already in table
 *    delete (symbol)         returns char* if symbol was in table
 *    apply                   so you can delete all symbols before die()
 *    die                     destroy symbol table (free up memory)
 *
 *  Supplementary functions include:
 *
 *    say                     how big? what % full?
 *    replace (symbol,newval) report previous value
 *    jam (symbol,value)      assert symbol:=value
 *
 *  You, the caller, have control over errors: this just reports them.
 *
 *  This package requires malloc(), free().
 *  Malloc(size) returns NULL or address of char[size].
 *  Free(address) frees same.
 */

/*
 *  The code and its structures are re-enterent.
 *  Before you do anything else, you must call hash_new() which will
 *  return the address of a hash-table-control-block (or NULL if there
 *  is not enough memory). You then use this address as a handle of the
 *  symbol table by passing it to all the other hash_...() functions.
 *  The only approved way to recover the memory used by the symbol table
 *  is to call hash_die() with the handle of the symbol table.
 *
 *  Before you call hash_die() you normally delete anything pointed to
 *  by individual symbols. After hash_die() you can't use that symbol
 *  table again.
 *
 *  The char* you associate with a symbol may not be NULL (0) because
 *  NULL is returned whenever a symbol is not in the table. Any other
 *  value is OK, except DELETED, #defined below.
 *
 *  When you supply a symbol string for insertion, YOU MUST PRESERVE THE
 *  STRING until that symbol is deleted from the table. The reason is that
 *  only the address you supply, NOT the symbol string itself, is stored
 *  in the symbol table.
 *
 *  You may delete and add symbols arbitrarily.
 *  Any or all symbols may have the same 'value' (char *). In fact, these
 *  routines don't do anything with your symbol values.
 *
 *  You have no right to know where the symbol:char* mapping is stored,
 *  because it moves around in memory; also because we may change how it
 *  works and we don't want to break your code do we? However the handle
 *  (address of struct hash_control) is never changed in
 *  the life of the symbol table.
 *
 *  What you CAN find out about a symbol table is:
 *    how many slots are in the hash table?
 *    how many slots are filled with symbols?
 *    (total hashes,collisions) for (reads,writes) (*)
 *  All of the above values vary in time.
 *  (*) some of these numbers will not be meaningful if we change the
 *  internals.

/*
 *  I N T E R N A L
 *
 *  Hash table is an array of hash_entries; each entry is a pointer to a
 *  a string and a user-supplied value 1 char* wide.
 *
 *  The array always has 2 ** n elements, n>0, n integer.
 *  There is also a 'wall' entry after the array, which is always empty
 *  and acts as a sentinel to stop running off the end of the array.
 *  When the array gets too full, we create a new array twice as large
 *  and re-hash the symbols into the new array, then forget the old array.
 *  (Of course, we copy the values into the new array before we junk the
 *  old array!)

/*
 *          h a s h _ a p p l y ( )
 *
 * Use this to scan each entry in symbol table.
 * For each symbol, this calls (applys) a nominated function supplying the
 * symbol's value (and the symbol's name).
 * The idea is you use this to destroy whatever is associted with
 * any values in the table BEFORE you destroy the table with hash_die.
 * Of course, you can use it for other jobs; whenever you need to
 * visit all extant symbols in the table.
 *
 * We choose to have a call-you-back idea for two reasons:
 *  asthetic: it is a neater idea to use apply than an explicit loop
 *  sensible: if we ever had to grow the symbol table (due to insertions)
 *            then we would lose our place in the table when we re-hashed
 *            symbols into the new table in a different order.
 *
 * The order symbols are visited depends entirely on the hashing function.
 * Whenever you insert a (symbol, value) you risk expanding the table. If
 * you do expand the table, then the hashing function WILL change, so you
 * MIGHT get a different order of symbols visited. In other words, if you
 * want the same order of visiting symbols as the last time you used
 * hash_apply() then you better not have done any hash_insert()s or
 * hash_jam()s since the last time you used hash_apply().
 *
 * In future we may use the value returned by your nominated function.
 * One idea is to abort the scan if, after applying the function to a
 * certain node, the function returns a certain code.
 * To be safe, please make your functions of type char *. If you always
 * return NULL, then the scan will complete, visiting every symbol in
 * the table exactly once. ALL OTHER RETURNED VALUES have no meaning yet!
 * Caveat Actor!
 *
 * The function you supply should be of the form:
 *      char * myfunct(string,value)
 *              char * string;        |* the symbol's name *|
 *              char * value;         |* the symbol's value *|
 *      {
 *        |* ... *|
 *        return(NULL);
 *      }
 *
 * The returned value of hash_apply() is (char*)NULL. In future it may return
 * other values. NULL means "completed scan OK". Other values have no meaning
 * yet. (The function has no graceful failures.)
