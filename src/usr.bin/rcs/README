This directory contains complete sources for version 4 of RCS.
Version 3 was included in the 4.3 BSD distribution. Features include:

1) Version 4 supports the "branch" keyword.

2) Numerous bug fixes. In addition, RCS now runs on many more machine
architectures, including Suns (3.x and 4.0), VAXen (4.2 and 4.3 BSD),
and IBM PC-ATs (Xenix).

3) Version 4 is backward compatible with version 3. Version 4 RCS will
handle files checked in under version 3 (but not vice versa).

4) This distribution is not supported in anyway. However, bugs and
(especially) bug fixes may be reported to rcs-bugs@cs.purdue.edu.

5) Older versions of diff do not support options used by RCS. It is
known that 4.3 BSD, and SunOS 3.2 (and later releases) support the
needed options. If your version of diff does not support these
options, obtain the GNU diff from the FSF.

under teh terms of the GNU General Public License.

7) All sources for RCS are contained in the "src" subdirectory. Read the
directions in its Makefile to set up the correct compile options for
building RCS on your system.

8) man pages reside in man.

9) Troff source for the paper "RCS A System for Version Control", which
appeared in Software Practice and Experience, can be found in "rcs.ms".
