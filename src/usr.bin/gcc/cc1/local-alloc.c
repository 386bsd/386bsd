/* Allocation of hard register numbers to pseudo registers is done in
   two passes.  In this pass we consider only regs that are born and
   die once within one basic block.  We do this one basic block at a
   time.  Then the next pass allocates the registers that remain.
   Two passes are used because this pass uses methods that work only
   on linear code, but that do a better job than the general methods
   used in global_alloc, and more quickly too.

   The assignments made are recorded in the vector reg_renumber
   whose space is allocated here.  The rtl code itself is not altered.

   We assign each instruction in the basic block a number
   which is its order from the beginning of the block.
   Then we can represent the lifetime of a pseudo register with
   a pair of numbers, and check for conflicts easily.
   We can record the availability of hard registers with a
   HARD_REG_SET for each instruction.  The HARD_REG_SET
   contains 0 or 1 for each hard reg.

   To avoid register shuffling, we tie registers together when one
   dies by being copied into another, or dies in an instruction that
   does arithmetic to produce another.  The tied registers are
   allocated as one.  Registers with different reg class preferences
   can never be tied unless the class preferred by one is a subclass
   of the one preferred by the other.

   Tying is represented with "quantity numbers".
   A non-tied register is given a new quantity number.
   Tied registers have the same quantity number.
   
   We have provision to exempt registers, even when they are contained
   within the block, that can be tied to others that are not contained in it.
   This is so that global_alloc could process them both and tie them then.
   But this is currently disabled since tying in global_alloc is not
   yet implemented.  */
