/* The purpose of this file is to define the characteristics of the i386,
   independent of assembler syntax or operating system.

   Three other files build on this one to describe a specific assembler syntax:
   bsd386.h, att386.h, and sun386.h.

   The actual tm.h file for a particular system should include
   this file, and then the file for the appropriate assembler syntax.

   Many macros that specify assembler syntax are omitted entirely from
   this file because they really belong in the files for particular
   assemblers.  These include AS1, AS2, AS3, RP, IP, LPREFIX, L_SIZE,
   PUT_OP_SIZE, USE_STAR, ADDR_BEG, ADDR_END, PRINT_IREG, PRINT_SCALE,
   PRINT_B_I_S, and many that start with ASM_ or end in ASM_OP.  */
