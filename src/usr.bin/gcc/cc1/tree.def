/* Each data type is represented by a tree node whose code is one of

/* Each node that represents a data type has a component TYPE_SIZE
   containing a tree that is an expression for the size in bits.
   The TYPE_MODE contains the machine mode for values of this type.
   The TYPE_POINTER_TO field contains a type for a pointer to this type,
     or zero if no such has been created yet.
   The TYPE_NEXT_VARIANT field is used to chain together types
     that are variants made by type modifiers such as "const" and "volatile".
   The TYPE_MAIN_VARIANT field, in any member of such a chain,
     points to the start of the chain.
   The TYPE_NONCOPIED_PARTS field is a list specifying which parts
     of an object of this type should *not* be copied by assignment.
     The TREE_PURPOSE of each element is the offset of the part
     and the TREE_VALUE is the size in bits of the part.
   The TYPE_NAME field contains info on the name used in the program
     for this type (for GDB symbol table output).  It is either a
     TYPE_DECL node, for types that are typedefs, or an IDENTIFIER_NODE
     in the case of structs, unions or enums that are known with a tag,
     or zero for types that have no special name.
   The TYPE_CONTEXT for any sort of type which could have a name or
    which could have named members (e.g. tagged types in C/C++) will
    point to the node which represents the scope of the given type, or
    will be NULL_TREE if the type has "file scope".  For most types, this
    will point to a BLOCK node or a FUNCTION_DECL node, but it could also
    point to a FUNCTION_TYPE node (for types whose scope is limited to the
    formal parameter list of some function type specification) or it
    could point to a RECORD_TYPE, UNION_TYPE or QUAL_UNION_TYPE node
    (for C++ "member" types).
    For non-tagged-types, TYPE_CONTEXT need not be set to anything in
    particular, since any type which is of some type category  (e.g.
    an array type or a function type) which cannot either have a name
    itself or have named members doesn't really have a "scope" per se.

/* Declarations.  All references to names are represented as ..._DECL nodes.
   The decls in one binding context are chained through the TREE_CHAIN field.
   Each DECL has a DECL_NAME field which contains an IDENTIFIER_NODE.
    (Some decls, most often labels, may have zero as the DECL_NAME).
   DECL_CONTEXT points to the node representing the context in which
    this declaration has its scope.  For FIELD_DECLs, this is the
    RECORD_TYPE, UNION_TYPE, or QUAL_UNION_TYPE node that the field
    is a member of.  For VAR_DECL, PARM_DECL, FUNCTION_DECL, LABEL_DECL,
    and CONST_DECL nodes, this points to the FUNCTION_DECL for the
    containing function, or else yields NULL_TREE if the given decl
    has "file scope".
   DECL_ABSTRACT_ORIGIN, if non-NULL, points to the original (abstract)
    ..._DECL node of which this decl is an (inlined or template expanded)
    instance.
   The TREE_TYPE field holds the data type of the object, when relevant.
    LABEL_DECLs have no data type.  For TYPE_DECL, the TREE_TYPE field
    contents are the type whose name is being declared.
   The DECL_ALIGN, DECL_SIZE,
    and DECL_MODE fields exist in decl nodes just as in type nodes.
    They are unused in LABEL_DECL, TYPE_DECL and CONST_DECL nodes.

   DECL_OFFSET holds an integer number of bits offset for the location.
   DECL_VOFFSET holds an expression for a variable offset; it is
   to be multiplied by DECL_VOFFSET_UNIT (an integer).
   These fields are relevant only in FIELD_DECLs and PARM_DECLs.

   DECL_INITIAL holds the value to initialize a variable to,
   or the value of a constant.  For a function, it holds the body
   (a node of type BLOCK representing the function's binding contour
   and whose body contains the function's statements.)  For a LABEL_DECL
   in C, it is a flag, nonzero if the label's definition has been seen.

   PARM_DECLs use a special field:
   DECL_ARG_TYPE is the type in which the argument is actually
    passed, which may be different from its type within the function.

   FUNCTION_DECLs use four special fields:
   DECL_ARGUMENTS holds a chain of PARM_DECL nodes for the arguments.
   DECL_RESULT holds a RESULT_DECL node for the value of a function,
    or it is 0 for a function that returns no value.
    (C functions returning void have zero here.)
   DECL_RESULT_TYPE holds the type in which the result is actually
    returned.  This is usually the same as the type of DECL_RESULT,
    but (1) it may be a wider integer type and
    (2) it remains valid, for the sake of inlining, even after the
    function's compilation is done.
   DECL_FUNCTION_CODE is a code number that is nonzero for
    built-in functions.  Its value is an enum built_in_function
    that says which built-in function it is.

   DECL_SOURCE_FILE holds a filename string and DECL_SOURCE_LINE
   holds a line number.  In some cases these can be the location of
   a reference, if no definition has been seen.

   DECL_ABSTRACT is non-zero if the decl represents an abstract instance
   of a decl (i.e. one which is nested within an abstract instance of a
   inline function.  */
