/* This is the loop optimization pass of the compiler.
   It finds invariant computations within loops and moves them
   to the beginning of the loop.  Then it identifies basic and 
   general induction variables.  Strength reduction is applied to the general
   induction variables, and induction variable elimination is applied to
   the basic induction variables.

   It also finds cases where
   a register is set within the loop by zero-extending a narrower value
   and changes these to zero the entire register once before the loop
   and merely copy the low part within the loop.

   Most of the complexity is in heuristics to decide when it is worth
   while to do these things.  */

     a branch here (actually, we need to pass both a jump and a label, but

/* Check whether an insn is an increment legitimate for a basic induction var.
   X is the source of insn P.
   DEST_REG is the putative biv, also the destination of the insn.
   We accept patterns of these forms:
     REG = REG + INVARIANT (includes REG = REG - CONSTANT)
     REG = INVARIANT + REG

   If X is suitable, we return 1, set *MULT_VAL to CONST1_RTX,
   and store the additive term into *INC_VAL.

   If X is an assignment of an invariant into DEST_REG, we set
   *MULT_VAL to CONST0_RTX, and store the invariant into *INC_VAL.

   We also want to detect a BIV when it corresponds to a variable
   whose mode was promoted via PROMOTED_MODE.  In that case, an increment
   of the variable may be a PLUS that adds a SUBREG of that variable to
   an invariant and then sign- or zero-extends the result of the PLUS
   into the variable.

   Most GIVs in such cases will be in the promoted mode, since that is the
   probably the natural computation mode (and almost certainly the mode
   used for addresses) on the machine.  So we view the pseudo-reg containing
   the variable as the BIV, as if it were simply incremented.

   Note that treating the entire pseudo as a BIV will result in making
   simple increments to any GIVs based on it.  However, if the variable
   overflows in its declared mode but not its promoted mode, the result will
   be incorrect.  This is acceptable if the variable is signed, since 
   overflows in such cases are undefined, but not if it is unsigned, since
   those overflows are defined.  So we only check for SIGN_EXTEND and
   not ZERO_EXTEND.

/* Given a jump insn JUMP, return the condition that will cause it to branch
   to its JUMP_LABEL.  If the condition cannot be understood, or is an
   inequality floating-point comparison which needs to be reversed, 0 will
   be returned.

   If EARLIEST is non-zero, it is a pointer to a place where the earliest
   insn used in locating the condition was found.  If a replacement test
   of the condition is desired, it should be placed in front of that
   insn and we will be sure that the inputs are still valid.

   The condition will be returned in a canonical form to simplify testing by
   callers.  Specifically:

   (1) The code will always be a comparison operation (EQ, NE, GT, etc.).
   (2) Both operands will be machine operands; (cc0) will have been replaced.
   (3) If an operand is a constant, it will be the second operand.
   (4) (LE x const) will be replaced with (LT x <const+1>) and similarly
       for GE, GEU, and LEU.  */
