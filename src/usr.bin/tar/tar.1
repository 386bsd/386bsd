.SH NAME
tar \- The GNU version of the sequential media archive utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtar\fP \fIfunction\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIfiles-list\fP]
.LP
The \fIfunction\fP, \fIoptions\fP, and \fIfiles-list\fP components
are described below in sections with those names.
There are several conventions which may be followed in the
specification of arguments for \fItar\fP.
These are described below under SYNTAX.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fItar\fP utility provides a way to store many files in an archive
(sometimes called a tar-file)
which may be kept as an ordinary file, stored on an I/O device
such as tape or disk, sent over a network, or piped to
another program.
.LP
It is especially  useful for making backup copies
and for packaging a set of
files for convenience of handling
or to move them to another system.
.LP
When desired, copies of the archived files may be
fully or selectively retrieved
from the archive
by another application of \fItar\fP.
.LP
You may also use \fItar\fP
to append, delete, update or list
files in an archive or to compare an archive with the current
state of a filesystem subtree.
.LP
The \fItar\fP utility is available for a wide variety
of operating systems and computer architectures which
makes it particularly useful for intersystem transfers.
Source code for \fItar\fP is freely available to simplify
porting it to additional systems.
.SH SYNTAX
Arguments to \fItar\fP can be specified in several ways. 
This is largely to accommodate
different preferences
in the trade off between compactness on the one hand
and improved mnemonic value and accompanying verbosity on the other,
and to allow
the continued use of old forms which have had
widespread use.
.LP
.B Compact Syntax
.br
The normal compact command syntax
conventions can be used:
.IP
The function designation conventionally appears first and
each option is separated by white space and
indicated by a `\-' followed immediately by a letter.
Any required value for an option is supplied by an argument
which directly follows that option;
.IP
Multiple options can be combined behind one `\-'
as long as they take no arguments.
.LP
.B Keyword Syntax
.br
The more mnemonic but more verbose keyword system of specifying
arguments is structurally similar to the first form above but
each option is specified by a full word or hyphenated phrase
and the lead\-in
is a `\-\|\-' instead of a single `\-'.
All arguments are separated by white
space and each value directly follows the corresponding keyword.
.LP
.B Traditional Syntax
.br
For compatibility with traditional 
\fItar\fP programs,
the function and options may also be specified as ``keyletters''
in the first argument to \fItar\fP
omitting the initial `\-'.
Any values required by the options occur as the second, third, etc.
arguments in the same order that the keyletters appeared.
.LP
.B Examples:
.br
The following examples show a sample command expressed in each of the 
styles described above:
.IP Compact:
tar -c -f arcname -v file1 file2
.IP Keyword:
tar \-\-create \-\-file arcname \-\-verbose file1 file2
.IP Traditional:
tar cfv arcname file1 file2
.SH FUNCTIONS
Exactly one of the functions in the following list
must be included.
The list includes each of the compact forms
followed by the corresponding keyword or words.
.IP "\fB\-A, \-\-catenate, \-\-concatenate"
Append existing tar-files to the archive.
.IP "\fB\-c, \-\-create"
Create a new archive containing the items specified by the \fIfiles-list\fP.
.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-diff, \-\-compare\fP"
Find differences between the archive and the file system.
.sp 0.5
Report
differences in file size, mode, uid, gid, and contents.  If a file
exists on the tape, but not in the file system, that is reported.
.IP "\fB\-r, \-\-append"
Append list items to the end of the archive.
.IP "\fB\-t, \-\-list"
List a table of contents of an existing archive.  If file names are
specified, just list files matching the specified names.  The listing
appears on the standard output.
.IP "\fB\-u, \-\-update"
Only  append list items that  are  newer than the current copy in
the archive.
.IP "\fB\-x, \-\-extract, \-\-get"
Extract files from an existing archive.
If a \fIfile-list\fP is 
specified, just extract files matching the list items,
otherwise extract
all the files in the archive.
.LP
To reduce the danger of accidental data loss
the following keyword function has no compact form.
.IP "\fB\\-\-delete\fP"
Delete \fIfiles-list\fP from the archive (not for use on mag tapes!).
.SH OPTIONS
The corresponding keywords are shown following the compact
forms in the following list.
.IP "\fB\-b, \-\-block-size\fP \fIN\fP"
Specify a blocking factor for the archive.  The block size will be
\fIN\fP x 512 bytes.  Larger blocks typically run faster and let you
fit more data on a tape.
.sp 0.5
The default blocking factor is set when
\fItar\fP is compiled, and is typically 20.
.sp 0.5
The maximum block size is limited by the lesser of the amount of memory
that can be allocated for a block and the maximum block size
that the device containing the archive can read or write.
.IP "\fB\-B, \-\-read-full-blocks"
When reading an archive, reblock it as we read it.
.sp 0.5
Normally, \fItar\fP reads each
block with a single \fIread(2)\fP system call.  This does not work
when reading from a pipe or network socket under \*(B3 .
\fIread(2)\fP only gives as much data as has arrived at the moment.
With this option, it
will do multiple \fIread(2)\fPs to fill out to a record boundary,
rather than reporting an error.
This option is the default when reading an archive from standard input,
or over a network.
.IP "\fB\-C, \-\-directory\fP \fIDIR\fP"
Change working directory to \fIDIR\fP.
This is the only option which may usefully appear more than once and
may appear after the \fIfiles-list\fP begins.
It changes the working directory for locating items
following it in the list until another \fB\-C\fP option
occurs or the end of the list is reached.
.sp 0.5
The \fB\-C\fP and \fB\-T\fP options may not be combined
in a \fItar\fP command.
.sp 0.5
If you really need to process a file named `\-C' it can be
referred to as `./\-C' in the list.
.IP "\fB\-f, \-\-file\fP \fI[HOSTNAME:]FILE\fP"
Use archive file or device \fIFILE\fP
(the default is taken from the environment variable TAPE
if it is defined, otherwise /dev/tape is used).
.sp 0.5
If the `\-' character appears alone as the archive name, it
indicates that the standard input is to be read as the archive
or that standard output is to be written as the archive
according to the function being performed.
.IP "\fB\-F, \-\-info-script, \-\-new-volume-script\fP \fIFILE\fP"
Run script at end of each volume (tape cartridge, diskette, etc.)
This option implies the multi-volume option \B-M\P.
.IP "\fB\-G, \-\-incremental"
Create, extract, etc.  old   GNU-format   incremental
backup.
.IP "\fB\-g, \-\-listed-incremental\fP \fIFILE\fP"
Create, extract, etc.   new   GNU-format  incremental
backup.
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-dereference\fP"
When creating an archive, if a symbolic link is encountered, dump
the file or directory to which it points, rather than
dumping it as a symbolic link.
.IP "\fB\-i, \-\-ignore-zeros\fP"
When reading an archive, ignore blocks of zeros appearing as headers
in the archive.  Normally such
a block of zeros indicates the end of the archive,
but in a damaged archive, or one which was
created by appending several archives, this option allows \fItar\fP to 
continue.
.sp 0.5
This option is not on by default because there is garbage written after the
zeroed blocks by some versions of the \fItar\fP program.
Note that with this option
set, \fItar\fP will read all the way to the end of the file, eliminating
some problems with multi-file tapes.
.IP "\fB\-k, \-\-keep-old-files\fP"
When extracting files from an archive, keep existing files, rather than
overwriting them with the version from the archive.
.IP "\fB\-K, \-\-starting-file\fP \fIFILE\fP"
Begin at file \fIFILE\fP in the archive.
.IP "\fB\-l, \-\-one-file-system"
When dumping the contents of a directory to an archive, stay within the
local file system of that directory.
That is, do not process the contents of a directory
which is a filesystem mount point encountered
while processing a directory included in the \fIfiles-list\fP.
.sp 0.5
This option
only affects the files dumped because
they are in a dumped directory; files named on the command line are
always dumped, and they can be from various file systems.
.sp 0.5
This is useful for making ``full dump'' archival backups of a file system,
as with the \fIdump\fP(8) command.  Files which are skipped due to this
option are mentioned on the standard error.
.IP "\fB\-L, \-\-tape-length\fP \fIN\fP"
Change tape, diskette, etc. after writing each \fIN\fP*1024 bytes.
.IP "\fB\-m, \-\-modification-time"
When extracting files from an archive,
set each file's modification timestamp
to the current time, rather than extracting each file's
modification timestamp from the archive.
.IP "\fB\-M, \-\-multi-volume"
Create, extract, etc. a multi-volume archive.
.IP "\fB\-N, \-\-after-date, \-\-newer\fP \fIDATE\fP"
Only store files newer than \fIDATE\fP.
.IP "\fB\-o, \-\-old-archive, \-\-portability"
When creating an archive, write an old format archive, which does not
include information about directories, pipes, fifos, 
contiguous files, or device files, and 
specifies file ownership by uid's and gid's rather than by
user names and group names.  In most cases, a ``new'' format archive
can be read by an ``old'' tar program without serious trouble, so this
option should seldom be needed.
.IP "\fB\-O, \-\-to-stdout"
Extract files to standard output.
.IP "\fB\-p, \-\-same-permissions, \-\-preserve-permissions\fP"
When extracting files from an archive,
restore them to the same permissions
that they had in the archive.
If \fB\-p\fP is not specified, the current
umask limits the permissions of the extracted files.
See \fIumask(2)\fP.
.IP "\fB\-P, \-\-absolute-paths\fP"
Don't strip leading `/'s from file names.
.IP "\fB\-R, \-\-record-number\fP"
When writing each message for a file incorporated into the archive
show the record position, i.e. which 512 byte block within the archive 
begins the file record and contains the header
information for the file. 
.sp 0.5
This option is especially
useful when reading damaged archives, since it helps to pinpoint the damaged
section.
.IP "\fB\-s, \-\-same-order, \-\-preserve-order\fP"
When using the \fB-T\fP option to specify the items to be listed,
compared
or extracted from an archive,
the \fB\-s\fP flag specifies that the list
is sorted into the same order as the archive.  This allows a large list
to be used, even on small machines, because
the entire list need not be read into memory at once.
.sp 0.5
Such a sorted
list can easily be created by running ``tar \-t'' on the archive and
editing its output.
.IP "\fB\-S, \-\-sparse\fP"
Handle sparse files efficiently.
.IP "\fB\-T, \-\-files-from\fP \fIFILE\fP"
Get the \fIfiles-list\fP to extract, include, etc. from file \fIFILE\fP
(one item per line) instead of the command line.
\fIFILE\fP may not include occurrences of the \fB\-C\fP option.
.sp 0.5
If \fIFILE\fP is the `\-' character alone 
the \fIfiles-list\fP is taken from the standard input,
one item per line.
.sp 0.5
If the \fB\-T\fP option is used, the \fIfiles-list\fP, if any,
appearing in the command will be ignored.
.sp 0.5
The \fB\-T\fP and \fB\-C\fP options may not be combined
in a \fItar\fP command.
.IP "\fB\-v, \-\-verbose"
Provide a message for each file processed to or from the archive.
.sp 0.5
If \fB\-v\fP is used with the \fB\-t\fP function the message
for each file is expanded to give details of file ownership,
size, modification date and permissions.
.IP "\fB\-V, \-\-label\fP \fINAME\fP"
Create archive with volume name \fINAME\fP.
.IP "\fB\-w, \-\-interactive, \-\-confirmation"
Ask for confirmation for every action.
.IP "\fB\-W, \-\-verify"
Attempt to verify the archive after writing it.
.IP "\fB\-X, \-\-exclude-from\fP \fIFILE\fP"
Exclude files listed in \fIFILE\fP.
.IP "\fB\-Z, \-\-compress, \-\-uncompress"
Filter the archive through compress.
.IP "\fB\-z, \-\-gzip, \-\-ungzip"
Filter the archive through gzip.
.LP
The following keyword options have no compact form:
.IP "\fB\-\-atime-preserve\fP"
Don't change access times on dumped files.
.IP "\fB\-\-checkpoint\fP"
List directory names while reading the archive.
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude\fP \fIFILE\fP"
Exclude file \fIFILE\fP.
.IP "\fB\-\-force-local\fP"
The archive file is local even if its name includes a colon.
.IP "\fB\-\-ignore-failed-read\fP"
Don't exit with non-zero status on unreadable files.
.IP "\fB\-\-preserve\fP"
Equivalent to both \fB\-p\fP and \fB\-s\fP options
i.e. \fB--preserve-order --preserve-permissions\fP.
.IP "\fB\-\-remove-files\fP"
Remove files after adding them to the archive.
.IP "\fB\-\-same-owner\fP"
Create extracted files with the same ownership.
.IP "\fB\-\-null\fP"
Make the \fB\-T\fP option read null-terminated names.
.IP "\fB\-\-totals\fP"
List total bytes written with \fB\-\-create\fP.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fP"
Display \fItar\fP program version number.
.IP "\fB\-\-use-compress-program\fP \fIPROG\fP
Filter  the archive through \fIPROG\fP
(which must accept the option \fB\-d\fP to indicate decompression).
.IP "\fB\-\-block-compress\fP"
Block the output of the compression program for tapes.
.IP "\fB\-[0-7][lmh]\fP"
This is an obsolete form used to specify tape drive and density.
.SH "FILES LIST"
The \fIfiles-list\fP may contain
working directory changes and
the names of items which are to be archived, extracted, etc.
according to the function selected.
.IP "\fB\-C\fP \fIdirectory_name\fP"
This is an instruction to change
the working directory to the specified directory.
Details appear in the description of \fB\-C\fP under OPTIONS.
.IP "\fIfile_name\fP
A file name as an item implies only the processing
of the named file.
.IP "\fIdirectory_name\fP
A directory name as an item implies that
the entire filesystem subtree
based there should be processed.
.LP
By default, if a
full path name is specified when creating an archive,
it will be written
to the archive without the initial "/",
to allow the files to be later
read into a different place than where they were
dumped from, and a warning will be printed.
.LP
If files are extracted from an archive which contains 
full path names, they will be extracted relative
to the current directory
and a warning message printed.
.LP
To modify the default behaviour use the
.I \-P or \-\-absolute-paths
option.
.LP
When extracting, comparing or listing an archive,
the items in the \fIfiles-list\fP refer to records
in the archive
and may contain wild card characters for filename substitution
using mostly the same forms as the shell, \fIsh\fP.
The shell actually matches each substring between ``/''s
separately,
while \fItar\fP matches the entire string at once,
so some anomalies will occur; e.g. ``*'' or ``?'' can match a ``/''.
.sp 0.5
To specify a regular
expression as an argument to \fItar\fP,
quote it so the shell will not
expand it.
