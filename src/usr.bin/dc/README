This is a preliminary release of GNU `dc', since people asked for it.  GNU
`bc' (which doesn't rely on a separate `dc') has been available separately
for a couple of years.  Eventually this version of `dc' will be merged with
the bc package. 

See comments in the file decimal.c for some limitations in the arbitrary
precision library.  It's questionable whether it's worth fixing these
problems since the merged dc will probably use bc's math library instead.
However, you might want to be aware of known problems. 

See the file `INSTALL' for instructions on building and installing dc.

Please report bugs to bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.
