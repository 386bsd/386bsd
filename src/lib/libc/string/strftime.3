.Sh NAME
.Nm strftime
.Nd format date and time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <time.h>
.Fd #include <string.h>
.Ft size_t
.Fn strftime "char *buf" "size_t maxsize" "const char *format" "const struct tm *timeptr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strftime
function formats the information from
.Fa timeptr
into the buffer
.Fa buf
according to the string pointed to by
.Fa format .
.Pp
The
.Fa format
string consists of zero or more conversion specifications and
ordinary characters.
All ordinary characters are copied directly into the buffer.
A conversion specification consists of a percent sign
.Dq Ql %
and one other character.
.Pp
No more than
.Fa maxsize
characters will be placed into the array.
If the total number of resulting characters, including the terminating
null character, is not more than
.Fa maxsize ,
.Fn strftime
returns the number of characters in the array, not counting the
terminating null.
Otherwise, zero is returned.
.Pp
Each conversion specification is replaced by the characters as
follows which are then copied into the buffer.
.Bl -tag -width "xxxx"
