.Fn symlink "const char *name1" "const char *name2"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A symbolic link
.Fa name2
is created to
.Fa name1
.Pf ( Fa name2
is the name of the
file created,
.Fa name1
is the string
used in creating the symbolic link).
Either name may be an arbitrary path name; the files need not
be on the same file system.

Upon successful completion, a zero value is returned.
If an error occurs, the error code is stored in
.Va errno
and a -1 value is returned.
.Sh ERRORS

.Bl -tag -width ENAMETOO
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR

.Fa name1
or
.Fa name2
contains a character with the high-order bit set.

.It Bq Er EROFS
The file
.Fa name2
would reside on a read-only file system.
