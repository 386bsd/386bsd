.Ft int
.Fn chroot "const char *dirname"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fa Dirname

.Fn Chroot
causes
.Fa dirname
to become the root directory,
that is, the starting point for path searches of pathnames
beginning with
.Ql / .

It should be noted that
.Fn chroot
has no effect on the process's current directory.

Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate an error.
