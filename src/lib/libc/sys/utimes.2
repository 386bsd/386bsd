If the times are specified (the
.Fa times
argument is
.Pf non- Dv NULL )
the caller must be the owner of the file or be the super-user.
.Pp
If the times are not specified (the
.Fa times
argument is
.Dv NULL )
the caller must be the owner of the file, have permission to
write the file, or be the super-user.
.Sh RETURN VALUES

Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.

access is denied.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
