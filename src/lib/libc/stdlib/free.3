.Nd free up memory allocated with malloc, calloc or realloc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <stdlib.h>

is a null pointer, no action occurs.
Otherwise, if the argument does not match a pointer earlier
returned by the
.Xr calloc ,
.Xr malloc ,
or
.Xr realloc
function, or if the space has been deallocated by a call to
.Fn free
or
.Xr realloc ,
general havoc may occur.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn free
function returns no value.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr calloc 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr realloc 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn free
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .
