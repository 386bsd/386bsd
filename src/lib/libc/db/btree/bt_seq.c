 * Sequential scan support.
 *
 * The tree can be scanned sequentially, starting from either end of the tree
 * or from any specific key.  A scan request before any scanning is done is
 * initialized as starting from the least node.
 *
 * Each tree has an EPGNO which has the current position of the cursor.  The
 * cursor has to survive deletions/insertions in the tree without losing its
 * position.  This is done by noting deletions without doing them, and then
 * doing them when the cursor moves (or the tree is closed).
