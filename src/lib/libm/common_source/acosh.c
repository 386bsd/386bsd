/* ACOSH(X)
 * RETURN THE INVERSE HYPERBOLIC COSINE OF X
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (VAX D FORMAT 56 BITS, IEEE DOUBLE 53 BITS)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 2/16/85;
 * REVISED BY K.C. NG on 3/6/85, 3/24/85, 4/16/85, 8/17/85.
 *
 * Required system supported functions :
 *	sqrt(x)
 *
 * Required kernel function:
 *	log1p(x) 		...return log(1+x)
 *
 * Method :
 *	Based on 
 *		acosh(x) = log [ x + sqrt(x*x-1) ]
 *	we have
 *		acosh(x) := log1p(x)+ln2,	if (x > 1.0E20); else		
 *		acosh(x) := log1p( sqrt(x-1) * (sqrt(x-1) + sqrt(x+1)) ) .
 *	These formulae avoid the over/underflow complication.
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	acosh(x) is NaN with signal if x<1.
 *	acosh(NaN) is NaN without signal.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	acosh(x) returns the exact inverse hyperbolic cosine of x nearly 
 *	rounded. In a test run with 512,000 random arguments on a VAX, the
 *	maximum observed error was 3.30 ulps (units of the last place) at
 *	x=1.0070493753568216 .
 *
 * Constants:
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants.
 * The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert
 * from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values
 * shown.
