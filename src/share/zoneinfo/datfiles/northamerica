# United States

# From Arthur David Olson:
# US Daylight Saving Time ended on the last Sunday of *October* in 1974.
# See, for example, the front page of the Saturday, October 26, 1974
# and Sunday, October 27, 1974 editions of the Washington Post.

# From seismo!munnari!kre:
# I recall also being told by someone once that Canada didn't have
# the DST variations in 74/75 that the US did, but I am not nearly
# sure enough of this to add anything.

# From Arthur David Olson:
# The above has been confirmed by Bob Devine; we'll go with it here.

# From Arthur David Olson:
# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.

# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):
# ...Alaska (and Hawaii) had the timezone names changed in 1967.

#    Nome Standard Time (NT)     Bering Standard Time (BST)
# 
# ...Alaska's timezone lines were redrawn in 1983 to give only 2 tz.
#    The YST zone now covers nearly all of the state, AHST just part
#    of the Aleutian islands.   No DST.

# From Arthur David Olson (January 21, 1989):
# The above dates are for 1988.
# Note the "AKST" and "AKDT" abbreviations, the claim that there's
# no DST in Samoa, and the claim that there is DST in Alaska and the
# Aleutians.

# From Arthur David Olson (February 13, 1988):
# Legal standard time zone names, from United States Code (1982 Edition and
# Supplement III), Title 15, Chapter 6, Section 260 and forward.  First, names
# up to April 1, 1967 (when most provisions of the Uniform Time Act of 1966
# took effect), as explained in sections 263 and 261:
#	(none)
#	United States standard eastern time
#	United States standard mountain time
#	United States standard central time
#	United States standard Pacific time
#	(none)
#	United States standard Alaska time
#	(none)
# Next, names from April 1, 1967 until November 30, 1983 (the date for
# public law 98-181):
#	Atlantic standard time
#	eastern standard time
#	central standard time
#	mountain standard time
#	Pacific standard time
#	Yukon standard time
#	Alaska-Hawaii standard time
#	Bering standard time
# And after November 30, 1983:
#	Atlantic standard time
#	eastern standard time
#	central standard time
#	mountain standard time
#	Pacific standard time
#	Alaska standard time
#	Hawaii-Aleutian standard time
#	Samoa standard time
# The law doesn't give abbreviations.

# Easy stuff first--including Alaska, where we ignore history (since we
# can't tell if we should give Yukon time or Alaska-Hawaii time for "old"
# times).

# Canada

# Canada is reportedly lots easier than the US--leastways since 1951.
# I don't know what they did before then.
# 4.3BSD claims that it's perfectly regular.
# According to a posting in "comp.bugs.misc", "comp.unix.wizards", etc.
# on February 8, 1987, by Dave Sherman of the Law Society of Upper Canada,
# "...Canada (well, Ontario and at least some of the other provinces) are
# adopting the new daylight savings time rules...".  We assume all of
# Canada is doing so.

# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):
# All of Canada did have DST from your first rule except Saskatchewan.
# Which parts did not observe DST is hard to pinpoint but most of the
# province follows the rules.
# NOTE: those that didn't have DST for that rule, also
# probably did not have it for several years previous.

# Mexico

# From Guy Harris:
# Rules are from the Official Airline Guide, Worldwide Edition, for 1987.
# Rules prior to 1987 are unknown.
# The comments in the OAG say "Only Ensenada, Mexicale, San Felipe and Tijuana
# observe DST."  This is presumably Baja California Norte, above 28th parallel,
# as listed there; Mexico/BajaSur is for "Baja California Sur and N. Pacific
# Coast (States of Sinaloa and Sonora)."

# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):
# The Federal District (where Mexico City is) has observed [DST] several
# times but not recently.
# 
# I don't where to drawn the line in the North Baja area.  28th latitude
# sounds good -- but it may be higher (how far [d]o radio stations from
# San Diego affect culture?).
# 
# The dates of DST probably go back to 1981.  The rules are the same as
# US's.  This is going to be a headache for US presidential electi[o]n years!

# From Arthur David Olson (February 13, 1988)
# Since the 1981 starting date is only "probable," we'll keep the 1987
# starting date below.
