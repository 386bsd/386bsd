.Nm nfsd

.Tn NFS
server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nfsd
.Op Fl r
.Bk -words
.Op Fl t Ar msk,mtch,hostadr1,hostadr2,...
.Ek
.Bk -words
.Op Fl u Ar msk,mtch,numprocs
.Ek
.Op Ar numprocs
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Nfsd
runs on a server machine to service
.Tn NFS
requests from client machines.
At least one
.Nm nfsd
must be running for a machine to operate as a server.
The options
.Fl u
and
.Fl t
are used to indicate which transport protocols are to be served.
.Pp
Options available to
.Nm nfsd :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl r
Register the
.Tn NFS
service with
.Xr portmap 8
without creating any servers. This option can be used along with the
.Fl u
or
.Fl t
options to re-register NFS if the portmap server is restarted.
.It Fl t
Serve
.Tn TCP NFS
clients.
.It Fl u
Serve
.Tn UDP NFS
clients.
.El
.Pp
The following arguments to the
.Fl u
or
.Fl t
options are used to specify parameters for service using the respective
protocol:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar msk , mtch
These arguments permit restriction of
.Tn NFS
services
to a subset of the host addresses. The
.Ar msk
and
.Ar mtch
are applied to the client host address as follows:
.Pp
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
if ((
.Ar host_address No \&& Em msk
) ==
.Ar mtch
)
.br
	\- service the client request
.br
else
.br
	\- drop the request
.Ed
.It Ar hostadr1 , ...
You may also specify zero or more specific host addresses to be accepted
as well as ones that pass the
.Ar msk , mtch
test above.
This may only be done for transport protocols that are connection based, such
as
.Tn TCP .
For the internet domain,
.Ar msk , mtch
and
.Ar hostadrs
are specified in internet
.Em dot
notation.
.It Ar numprocs
Specifies how many servers to fork off. This may only be specified for
non-connection based protocols such as
.Tn UDP .
.El
.Pp
If neither
.Fl u
or
.Fl t
are specified,
.Ar numprocs
servers for
.Tn UDP
accepting requests from all clients are started.
If
.Ar numprocs
is not specified, it defaults to 1.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal
nfsd \-u 255.255.255.0,131.104.48.0,4 \-t \e
	255.255.0.0,131.104.0.0,131.102.31.2
.Ed
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
Serves
.Tn UDP
and
.Tn TCP
transports. For
.Tn UDP ,
it runs 4 daemons that accept requests
from any client on subnet 131.104.48.
For
.Tn TCP ,
it accepts connections from any client on network 131.104
plus the client with the address 131.102.31.2.
.El
.Bd -literal
nfsd \-u 255.255.240.0,131.104.0.0,6 \-t 0,0
.Ed
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
Serves
.Tn UDP
and
.Tn TCP
transports.
For
.Tn UDP ,
it runs 6 daemons that accept requests from clients with
addresses in the range 131.104.0.x - 131.104.15.x.
For
.Tn TCP ,
it accepts connections from any client.
.El
.Pp
.Li nfsd \-u 0,0,4
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
Serves any
.Tn UDP
client with 4 servers, only.
.El
.Pp
.Li nfsd 4
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
Serves any
.Tn UDP
client with 4 servers, only. (Compatibility)
.El
.Pp
A server should typically run enough daemons to handle
the maximum level of concurrency from its clients,
typically four to six.
.Pp
.Nm Nfsd
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC1094.

.Sh BUGS
The client host address restrictions specified here are unrelated to
the mount restrictions specified in
.Pa /etc/exports
for
.Xr mountd 8 .
