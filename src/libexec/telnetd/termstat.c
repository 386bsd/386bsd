/*
 * localstat
 *
 * This function handles all management of linemode.
 *
 * Linemode allows the client to do the local editing of data
 * and send only complete lines to the server.  Linemode state is
 * based on the state of the pty driver.  If the pty is set for
 * external processing, then we can use linemode.  Further, if we
 * can use real linemode, then we can look at the edit control bits
 * in the pty to determine what editing the client should do.
 *
 * Linemode support uses the following state flags to keep track of
 * current and desired linemode state.
 *	alwayslinemode : true if -l was specified on the telnetd
 * 	command line.  It means to have linemode on as much as
 *	possible.
 *
 * 	lmodetype: signifies whether the client can
 *	handle real linemode, or if use of kludgeomatic linemode
 *	is preferred.  It will be set to one of the following:
 *		REAL_LINEMODE : use linemode option
 *		KLUDGE_LINEMODE : use kludge linemode
 *		NO_LINEMODE : client is ignorant of linemode
 *
 *	linemode, uselinemode : linemode is true if linemode
 *	is currently on, uselinemode is the state that we wish
 *	to be in.  If another function wishes to turn linemode
 *	on or off, it sets or clears uselinemode.
 *
 *	editmode, useeditmode : like linemode/uselinemode, but
 *	these contain the edit mode states (edit and trapsig).
 *
 * The state variables correspond to some of the state information
 * in the pty.
 *	linemode:
 *		In real linemode, this corresponds to whether the pty
 *		expects external processing of incoming data.
 *		In kludge linemode, this more closely corresponds to the
 *		whether normal processing is on or not.  (ICANON in
 *		system V, or COOKED mode in BSD.)
 *		If the -l option was specified (alwayslinemode), then
 *		an attempt is made to force external processing on at
 *		all times.
 *
 * The following heuristics are applied to determine linemode
 * handling within the server.
 *	1) Early on in starting up the server, an attempt is made
 *	   to negotiate the linemode option.  If this succeeds
 *	   then lmodetype is set to REAL_LINEMODE and all linemode
 *	   processing occurs in the context of the linemode option.
 *	2) If the attempt to negotiate the linemode option failed,
 *	   then we try to use kludge linemode.  We test for this
 *	   capability by sending "do Timing Mark".  If a positive
 *	   response comes back, then we assume that the client
 *	   understands kludge linemode (ech!) and the
 *	   lmodetype flag is set to KLUDGE_LINEMODE.
 *	3) Otherwise, linemode is not supported at all and
 *	   lmodetype remains set to NO_LINEMODE (which happens
 *	   to be 0 for convenience).
 *	4) At any time a command arrives that implies a higher
 *	   state of linemode support in the client, we move to that
 *	   linemode support.
 *
 * A short explanation of kludge linemode is in order here.
 *	1) The heuristic to determine support for kludge linemode
 *	   is to send a do timing mark.  We assume that a client
 *	   that supports timing marks also supports kludge linemode.
 *	   A risky proposition at best.
 *	2) Further negotiation of linemode is done by changing the
 *	   the server's state regarding SGA.  If server will SGA,
 *	   then linemode is off, if server won't SGA, then linemode
 *	   is on.
