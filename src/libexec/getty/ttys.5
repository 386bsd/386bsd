.Sh NAME
.Nm ttys
.Nd terminal initialization information
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm ttys
contains information that is used by various routines to initialize
and control the use of terminal special files.
This information is read with the
.Xr getttyent 3
library routines.
The
There is one line in the 
.Nm ttys
file per special device file.
Fields are separated by tabs and/or spaces.
Fields comprised of more than one word should be enclosed in double
quotes (``"'').
Blank lines and comments may appear anywhere in the file; comments
are delimited by hash marks (``#'') and new lines.
Any unspecified fields will default to null.
.Pp
The first field is the
name of the terminal special file as it is found in
.Pa /dev .
.Pp
The second field of the file is the command to execute for the line,
usually
.Xr getty 8 ,
which initializes and opens the line, setting the speed, waiting for
a user name and executing the
.Xr login 1
program.
It can be, however, any desired command, for example
the start up for a window system terminal emulator or some other
daemon process, and can contain multiple words if quoted.
.Pp
The third field is the type of terminal usually connected to that
tty line, normally the one found in the
.Xr termcap 5
data base file.
The environment variable
.Dv TERM
is initialized with the value by
either
.Xr getty 8
or
.Xr login 1 .
.Pp
The remaining fields set flags in the
.Fa ty_status
entry (see
.Xr getttyent 3 )
or specify a window system process that
.Xr init 8
will maintain for the terminal line.
.Pp
As flag values, the strings ``on'' and ``off'' specify that
.Xr init
should (should not) execute the command given in the second field,
while ``secure'' (if ``on'' is also specified) allows users with a
uid of 0 to login on
this line.
These flag fields should not be quoted.
.Pp
The string ``window='' may be followed by a quoted command
string which
.Xr init
will execute
.Em before
starting the command specified by the second field.
