Read the comments at the top of the Makefile, then edit the area marked
'configurable stuff'.

Edit config.h.  The stuff I expect you to change is down a bit from the
top of the file, but it's clearly marked.  Also look at pathnames.h.

You don't have to create the /var/cron or /var/cron/tabs directories, since
both the daemon and the `crontab' program will do this the first time they
run if they don't exist.  You do need to have a /var, though -- just "mkdir
/var" if you don't have one, or you can "mkdir /usr/var; ln -s /usr/var /var"
if you expect your /var to have a lot of stuff in it.

You will also need /usr/local/etc and /usr/local/bin directories unless you
change the Makefile.  These will have to be created by hand, but if you are
a long-time Usenet user you probably have them already.  /usr/local/man is
where I keep my man pages, but I have the source for `man' and you probably
do not.  Therefore you may have to put the man pages into /usr/man/manl,
which will be hard since there will be name collisions.  (Note that the man
command was originally written by Bill Joy before he left Berkeley, and it
contains no AT&T code, so it is in UUNET's archive of freely-distributable
BSD code.)

LINUX note: /usr/include/paths.h on some linux systems shows _PATH_SENDMAIL
	to be /usr/bin/sendmail even though sendmail is installed in /usr/lib.
	you should check this out.

say:
	make all

su and say:
	make install

Note that if I can get you to "su and say" something just by asking, you have
a very serious security problem on your system and you should look into it.

Edit your /usr/lib/crontab file into little pieces -- see the CONVERSION file
for help on this.

Use the `crontab' command to install all the little pieces you just created.
Some examples (see below before trying any of these!)

	crontab -u uucp -r /usr/lib/uucp/crontab.src
	crontab -u news -r /usr/lib/news/crontab.src
	crontab -u root -r /usr/adm/crontab.src

Notes on above examples: (1) the .src files are copied at the time the
command is issued; changing the source files later will have no effect until
they are reinstalled with another `crontab -r' command.  (2) The crontab
command will affect the crontab of the person using the command unless `-u
USER' is given; `-u' only works for root.  When using most `su' commands
under most BSD's, `crontab' will still think of you as yourself even though
you may think of yourself as root -- so use `-u' liberally.  (3) the `-r'
option stands for `replace'; check the man page for crontab(1) for other
possibilities.

Kill your existing cron daemon -- do `ps aux' and look for /etc/cron.

Edit your /etc/rc or /etc/rc.local, looking for the line that starts up
/etc/cron.  Comment it out and add a line to start the new cron daemon
-- usually /usr/local/etc/cron, unless you changed it in the Makefile.

Start up this cron daemon yourself as root.  Just type /usr/local/etc/cron
(or whatever); no '&' is needed since the daemon forks itself and the
process you executed returns immediately.

ATT notes: for those people unfortunate enough to be stuck on a AT&T UNIX,
you will need the public-domain "libndir", found in the B News source and in
any comp.sources.unix archive.  You will also need to hack the code some.
