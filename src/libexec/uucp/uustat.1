.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I uustat
command can display various types of status information about the UUCP
system.  It can also be used to cancel or rejuvenate requests made by
.I uucp
(1) or
.I uux
(1).

By default
.I uustat
displays all jobs queued up for the invoking user, as if given the
.B \-u
option with the appropriate argument.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options may be given to
.I uustat.
.TP 5
.B \-a
List all queued jobs.
.TP 5
.B \-s system
List all jobs queued up for the named system.  This option may be
specified multiple times, in which case all jobs for all the systems
will be listed.  The
.B \-u,
.B \-o,
and
.B \-y
options may be used to restrict which jobs are listed.
.TP 5
.B \-u user
List all jobs queued up for the named user.  This option may be
specified multiple times, in which case all jobs for all the users
will be listed.  The
.B \-s,
.B \-o,
and
.B \-y
options may be used to restrict which jobs are listed.
.TP 5
.B \-o hours
List all queued jobs older than the given number of hours.  The
.B \-s,
.B \-u,
and
.B \-y
options may be used to further restrict which jobs are listed.
.TP 5
.B \-y hours
List all queued jobs younger than the given number of hours.  The
.B \-s,
.B \-u,
and
.B \-o
options may be used to further restrict which jobs are listed.
.TP 5
.B \-k jobid
Kill the named job.  The job id is shown by the
.B \-s,
.B \-u,
.B \-o,
or
.B \-y
options, as well as by the
.B \-j
option to
.I uucp
(1) or
.I uux
(1).  A job may only be killed by the user who created the job, or by
the UUCP administrator or the superuser.  The
.B \-k
option may be used multiple times on the command line to kill several
jobs.
.TP 5
.B \-r jobid
Rejuvenate the named job.  This will mark it as having been invoked at
the current time, affecting the output of the
.B \-o
or
.B \-y
options and preserving it from any automated cleanup daemon.  The job
id is shown by the
.B \-s,
.B \-u,
.B \-o,
or
.B \-y
options, as well as by the
.B \-j
option to
.I uucp
(1) or
.I uux
(1).  A job may only be rejuvenated by the user who created the job,
or by the UUCP administrator or the superuser.  The
.B \-r
option may be used multiple times on the command line to rejuvenate
several jobs.
.TP 5
.B \-q
Display the status of commands, executions and conversations for all
remote systems for which commands or executions are queued.
.TP 5
.B \-m
Display the status of conversations for all remote systems.
.TP 5
.B \-p
Display the status of all processes holding UUCP locks on systems or
ports.
.TP 5
.B \-x type
Turn on particular debugging types.  The following types are
recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port,
config, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing.  Only abnormal, config,
spooldir and execute are meaningful for
.I uustat.

Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and the
.B \-x
option may appear multiple times.  A number may also be given, which
will turn on that many types from the foregoing list; for example,
.B \-x 2
is equivalent to
.B \-x abnormal,chat.
.TP 5
.B \-I file
Set configuration file to use.  This option may not be available,
depending upon how
.I uustat
was compiled.
.SH EXAMPLES
.EX
uustat -a
.EE
Display status of all jobs.  A sample output line is as follows:
.EX
bugsA027h bugs ian 1992-04-01 13:50:04 Executing rmail ian@airs.com (sending 1283 bytes)
.EE
The format is
.EX
jobid system user queue-date command (size)
.EE
The jobid may be passed to the
.B \-k
or
.B \-r
options.
The size indicates how much data is to be transferred to the remote
system, and is absent for a file receive request.

The
.B \-s,
.B \-u,
.B \-o,
and
.B \-y
options also produce output in the above format.

.EX
uustat -q
.EE
Display status for all systems with queued up commands.  A sample
output line is as follows:
.EX
bugs 4C (1 hour) 0X (0 secs) 1992-04-01 14:45:47 Dial failed
.EE
This indicates the system, the number of queued commands, the age of
the oldest queued command, the number of queued local executions, the
age of the oldest queued execution, the date of the last conversation,
and the status of that conversation.

.EX
uustat -m
.EE
Display conversation status for all remote systems.  A sample output
line is as follows:
.EX
bugs 1992-04-01 15:51:30 Conversation complete
.EE
This indicates the system, the date of the last conversation, and the
status of that conversation.  If the last conversation failed,
.I uustat
will indicate how many attempts have been made to call the system.  If
the retry period is currently preventing calls to that system,
.I uustat
also displays the time when the next call will be permitted.

.EX
uustat -p
.EE
Display the status of all processes holding UUCP locks.  The output
format is system dependent, as
.I uustat
simply invokes
.I ps
(1) on each process holding a lock.
.SH FILES
The file names may be changed at compilation time or by the
configuration file, so these are only approximations.

.br
/usr/lib/uucp/config - Configuration file.
.br
/usr/spool/uucp -
UUCP spool directory.
