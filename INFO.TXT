                                  Information


               We  are  pleased  to  announce  the  release  of 386BSD
          Release 1.0,  the  first  official  edition  of  the  386BSD
          operating  system created and developed by William and Lynne
          Jolitz  and  the  seventh  in  a  series  of  releases.   To
          encourage  innovation  in  design,  the  complete source and
          binary software is made available to other official Internet
          archive  sites  for  distribution  to students, faculty, and
          other interested users for educational and research use from
          the   Internet  site  _b_s_d_s_e_r_v_e_r._u_c_s_f._e_d_u.   If  you  are  an
          official Internet site and wish to  mirror  386BSD  releases
          and updates, please contact the administrator.

               The  386BSD  Release  1.0 system sources and executable
          binaries are available for research and educational use.  To
          make  it  simple to install and load by the student, we have
          included a bootable _T_i_n_y _3_8_6_B_S_D floppy containing a  minimal
          386BSD  Release  1.0  system  from  which  the  rest  of the
          distribution can be loaded from the network.

               If you cannot obtain or download  the  bootable  floppy
          and  would like one, send a SASE floppy mailer and formatted
          error-free 3.5-inch floppy to: Dr.  Dobbs  Journal  Careware
          Program,  Tiny  386BSD  Release  1.0,  411 Borel Avenue, San
          Mateo, CA. 94402 USA. There is no charge  for  the  service,
          but  if  you would like to send a dollar or more to help the
          kids helped by the "Childrens Support  League  of  the  East
          Bay", it would be most kind.

               The  _3_8_6_B_S_D  _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e  _C_D-_R_O_M  is  a  bootable  CD-ROM
          containing not only the complete Release 1.0 system software
          but also the complete 386BSD article series appearing in _D_r.
          _D_o_b_b_s _J_o_u_r_n_a_l,  along  with  completely  new  select  kernel
          source  annotation  discussions  and  other  writings  about
          386BSD  on  modularity,  386BSD  history  and  new  research
          directions.  It  even  contains the original 386BSD software
          specification written in 1989: _3_8_6_B_S_D:  _A  _M_o_d_e_s_t  _P_r_o_p_o_s_a_l.
          In  addition, sections from the pending book _3_8_6_B_S_D _F_r_o_m _t_h_e
          _I_n_s_i_d_e-_O_u_t are included to illustrate key concepts discussed
          in  the  annotations, articles, and other writings.  Most of
          these writings have never before appeared in print  and  are
          intended  to  assist  the student, developer, or designer in
          learning more about the  internals  of  a  modern  operating
          system.

               386BSD releases are done in the spirit  of  opening  up
          discussion  on  the  many  new  ideas  brought forth by many
          bright programmers. 386BSD is also meant to encourage people
          to take a risk and try out some of these new ideas.

               The  authors/editors  of  the  386BSD  releases make no
          concessions as to the content or  style  of  these  releases
          where  it  affects  innovation and new ideas, and we make no
          apologies for abandoning the past -- even  when  it  affects
          our  own  prior work.  As with all of our previous works, we
          take full responsibility for the content and code  contained
          within.  We  hope  that  this _l_i_v_i_n_g _e_x_a_m_p_l_e of an operating
          system lives  up  to  its  mission  as  an  educational  and
          research platform for new ideas.

               However, thoughtful "Letters to the Editors" are always
          welcome and always read.

               Organized in the style of an anthology, 386BSD releases
          are  a  compendium  of our own years of effort, coupled with
          work done by other programmers which has  been  released  to
          the   public  or  submitted  directly  to  us  for  possible
          inclusion into 386BSD releases. This disparate set of  works
          is  then  shaped  and  edited  by the authors into the final
          operational and high-performance  system  known  as  _3_8_6_B_S_D.
          Like  short  stories  in a book, individual contributions by
          the original author are cited within the actual source  code
          files.   The  only difference is that this operating systems
          "anthology" also runs on your PC!

               To avoid "kernel bloat"  --  the  massive  stuffing  of
          useless,  arcane  and  incorrect  code into the kernel -- we
          spend much of our time critically examining the kernel  code
          and paring the system down to a modern efficient form.  This
          allows us to be able to  more  fully  document  and  discuss
          every  element  of  the  kernel  and  better  focus  on  its
          educational and research aspects.

               A   complete   discussion    on    design    decisions,
          implementation, and future directions of select kernel files
          is contained in the "386BSD Annotations"  Windows  group  as
          part   of   the   _3_8_6_B_S_D  _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e  _C_D-_R_O_M.   In  addition,

          additional discussions on  methodology,  research  criteria,
          and  research  directions are contained in the "Introduction
          to 386BSD" Windows group on this same CD-ROM.

               The Tiny 386BSD  careware  floppy  contains  a  minimal
          386BSD  system  which can be booted, examined, and installed
          on a PC. Simply insert the floppy and  reboot  the  PC.   To
          install  the  Tiny  386BSD  system  on  a  hard  disk,  type
          "install".  Information on the 386BSD installation procedure
          is  now  interactive  as  part  of  the install process. The
          current minimal system configuration  required  to  run  the
          binaries  without  X-windows  is  40  MBytes. We recommend a
          minimum of 200  MBytes  when  using  386BSD  as  a  standard
          development   system.   Significantly  more  disk  space  is
          required when using applications packages such as  WAIS  and
          should be planned for accordingly.

               If  you  use  are  using an older version of the system
          (Release  0.2  or  older),  and  have  customized  it   with
          nonstandard  drivers not supported in the main release, make
          sure  you  keep  a  backup  of  your  older  patched  system
          available   for  use  as  needed  until  you  upgrade  these
          nonstandard   drivers   to   Release   1.0.    The    driver
          qualification  process  has been extremely simplified due to
          the new modular kernel arrangement (see  the  online  manual
          references  on  _k_e_r_n(_7)  and _h_i_e_r(_7) for more information on
          the 386BSD modular kernel and system  filesystem  hierarchy,
          respectively).   Please  read  the  detailed  discussion  on
          modular kernel organization in the "Introduction to  386BSD"
          Windows  group on the _3_8_6_B_S_D _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _C_D-_R_O_M if you require
          additional information.

               We'd  both  like  to thank you again for supporting the
          Careware Program, and for  your  patience,  enthusiasm,  and
          encouragement  over  the  last five years of 386BSD releases
          and writings.  We hope that you find  this  new  release  of
          386BSD  a  positive  experience  while  exploring  operating
          systems and networking innovations in design, and will  find
          the ideas contained within 386BSD of use in your personal or
          professional endeavors.

               Cordially,

          Bill and Lynne Jolitz.
