                  Software Support and Submissions Guidelines

               386BSD  is an experimental research system intended for
          exploration and study. The inclusion of source  code  allows
          the creative and industrious student of operating systems to
          modify, correct, augment and otherwise alter the  system  in
          any   manner   desired,  and  thus  is  made  available  for
          informational purposes only.  Due to the  unique  nature  of
          386BSD  releases,  we cannot provide "on-demand" support. If
          you have critical support needs, we suggest the purchase  of
          a  commercial  binary  systems  product from a major systems
          vendor, such as Microsoft or Sun Microsystems.

               We  do  encourage  feedback,  however,  on  bug  fixes,
          problems and solutions which arise during configuration, and
          improvements to 386BSD.  These changes may  be  incorporated
          back  into  the system, and made available once again to the
          386BSD audience, to further encourage use  of  this  system.
          Please use this SOFTSUB.TXT form for submissions of problems
          isolated,  bug  fixes,  or  new  work.   We  do  not  accept
          proprietary or licensed code submissions for review.

               If  you  are  a qualified research or educational group
          using 386BSD in a research or educational project, we may be
          able   to  provide  limited  technical  assistance.   Please
          contact ljolitz@cardio.ucsf.edu to describe  the  nature  of
          your  project  and  needs.  Due  to  the  volume  of  email,
          inquiries not related to research and  educational  projects
          may  not receive a response from this email address.  Please
          use the designated bsdserver  email  address  for  email  on
          problems  isolated,  bug fixes, and software submissions for
          386BSD.

               We  are  always  pleased  to  look   at   enhancements,
          additions  or  ports  of public domain software for possible
          incorporation into 386BSD releases.  However,  all  software
          submissions must contain the following items:

          1.   The  author's  name, date, and copyright (if any). If a
               modification  of  a  public-domain  work,  modification
               attribution and original author.

          2.   A brief description of the software module or item.

          3.   The  following  statement:  "This software contains, to
               the best of my knowledge, no proprietary, trade secret,
               or   otherwise  encumbered  code.   I  am  making  this

               software  available  for  incorporation  into   386BSD,
               understanding  that  386BSD is a freely redistributable
               and modifiable system."

               In addition, the software should be  in  the  following
          format:

          1.   386BSD   Release   number  upon  which  code  has  been
               generated (e.g. 1.0)

          2.   Source  code  and  generated  executable   binary   for
               testing.

          3.   List of known bugs.

               386BSD  is  a  freely  available  work.  All developers
          submitting software for official 386BSD releases  should  be
          aware of this fact. Given the extremely wide distribution of
          this release, we cannot regulate or enforce specific  usage,
          license, or proprietary restrictions, nor can we collect any
          monies or  fees  for  use.  Those  developers  who  wish  to
          encumber  their  software in this manner should find another
          mechanism for distribution.

               For completely novel programs (not  modified  works  of
          other  authors), we suggest either the BSD copyright format,
          the Free Software Foundation (GNU)  copyleft  format,  or  a
          standard  "public  domain"  notice  (e.g. MY NAME, author of
          this work, places this code into the public  domain,  DATE).
          Legal  and  administrative  restrictions  present at various
          research facilities preclude incorporation of any copylefted
          code  into  the  386BSD  kernel module. All other modules or
          applications packages are not restricted since they are  not
          dependent  on  system  operation and can be removed prior to
          use.

               Due  to  constraints  on  distribution  size,  research
          directions,  and  number of submissions, we cannot guarantee
          that any particular piece of software will  be  incorporated
          into  the  next  release,  nor  can  we  always  respond  to
          inquiries. Submitted works will not be returned,  so  always
          keep a copy on file.

               However,  we  do  review  all  appropriately documented
          submitted  work.  Please  email  software   submissions   to
          386bsd_softsub@bsdserver.ucsf.edu or mail directly to: Lynne
          Jolitz, 386BSD Reference CDROM Software Submissions, C/O Dr.
          Dobbs  Journal,  411 Borel Avenue, San Mateo, CA. 94402 USA.
          We will not review any code which is marked "proprietary" or
          "trade secret".
