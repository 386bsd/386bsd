 * There are two major kinds of pte's: those which have ever existed (and are
 * thus either now in core or on the swap device), and those which have
 * never existed, but which will be filled on demand at first reference.
 * There is a structure describing each.  There is also an ancillary
 * structure used in page clustering.
