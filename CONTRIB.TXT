          Many people and firms have provided hardware and/or money to
          try and  keep  this  unfunded  project  going  through  many
          releases  despite  a  recession and hard times -- usually by
          digging into their own pockets.  Each of these  contributors
          gave,  not  only because they believed that the continuation
          of  386BSD  is  vital  to  the  health  of   the   research,
          educational,  and  development communities, but also because
          they  realize  that  an  individual  can  and  does  make  a
          difference!

          Without  the  help  of  the  people listed here, this system
          software release would simply not have been  possible.   The
          rest  of  the 386BSD user community should make special note
          of all these people and firms and  commend  them  for  their
          generosity and foresight.

          We  hope  that  their  leadership  and  vision will serve as
          shining examples to the entire 386BSD  user  community,  and
          serve to encourage others to actively participate in 386BSD.

               The  first public release of 386BSD, 386BSD Release 0.0
          (March 1992), was based on the source code contained in  the
          EECS  Department  Networking  2  Release  -- a compendium of
          software source code done by developers all over  the  world
          and   contributed   to  the  University  of  California  for
          redistribution to the public (see source code  listings  for
          authorship   and   copyright  restrictions).   This  release
          contained the prior unencumbered  386BSD  source  code  work


          338866BBSSDD CCOONNTTRRIIBB LLIISSTT           66                  AAuugguusstt 11999944










          done  by William Jolitz. The missing kernel software modules
          (some of them major omissions) and release  engineering  was
          also done solely by William Jolitz. See the two-part article
          _3_8_6_B_S_D: _M_i_s_s_i_n_g _P_i_e_c_e_s, _D_r. _D_o_b_b_s  _J_o_u_r_n_a_l,  June-July  1992
          for  information on the methodology and construction of this
          first complete and unencumbered 386BSD systems release  (the
          complete series is available as part of the _3_8_6_B_S_D _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
          _C_D).

               Since that first release, many people have developed or
          enhanced  new  software  programs  and modules and conducted
          ports of popular public domain  user  programs  featured  as
          part  of  this  release.   While  some  of this software was
          directly contributed to us, most items were  made  available
          to  all  users  via  the Internet and been incorporated into
          many personal variants  of  386BSD.   Occasionally,  several
          people  came  up  with  a variety of approaches for a single
          item. In this instance, we tried to choose the one which  we
          felt  would  best serve the rest of the 386BSD user base for
          this release.  However, the creativity and  perseverance  of
          all  the  software contributors trying to make 386BSD better
          for the entire 386BSD user community was considerable.  Each
          individual  effort  is  worthy of pride.  386BSD Release 0.1
          was an attempt to consolidate and set a baseline  for  these
          changes.  It  consisted of a fully fleshed out stable system
          based on the older Release 0.0 technology contained  in  the
          NET/2  release,  coupled  with  the  many popular publically
          available applications and development packages used in many
          Unix systems.

               Release  1.0,  in  contrast,  begins a reexamination of
          this older technology and incorporates some of the new ideas
          and  paradigm  shifts  contemplated  in BSD operating system
          design ever since this project began  in  1989  --  some  of
          which  have  been  discussed  since the early 1980's.  It is
          humbling to realize that after five years of work, 386BSD is
          only  now  becoming  the experimental platform for new ideas
          that was intended, and that there is still much new work  to
          do.   As  such,  while  scanning  the source files contained
          within this release, we ask that you make a special note  of
          the  many  people  who have created new work over the years,
          for these are the people to watch in the next  five  to  ten
          years.

               We  wish  to  personally  thank all of these people, as
          they  have  helped  speed  386BSD  releases  back   to   the
          contributor  and  all  other  users  of 386BSD. We hope that
          these contributors and all  the  rest  of  the  386BSD  user
          community   will   continue   this   cycle   of   new  work,
          incorporation, testing, and release, in order to make future
          releases even better!
